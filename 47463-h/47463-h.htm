<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pc1 small">&mdash;&mdash;&#9670;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> health of my wife having rendered it advisable to spend
a winter in the South of France, I made arrangements to
accompany her, and we left home in October 1876. After
a short stay at Cannes and three months in Mentone, with
marked improvement, we made a tour of four months in
Italy, and then passing the remainder of the summer of 1877
in Switzerland, and the autumn chiefly in Biarritz and Pau,
we spent a second winter in the Riviera, principally in
Mentone, returning to England <i>viâ</i> Turin in May 1878.</p>

<p class="p2">We had visited so many places, and seen so much while
thus travelling during our first year, that it occurred to me,
during our second sojourn at Mentone, to write out some
notes of what had come within our knowledge which might
prove both useful and interesting to others, and particularly
to those who desired to winter in the Riviera. The field,
however, was large, and to bring observation into reasonable
compass I could only present general views&mdash;indications
merely&mdash;of what we had seen; and, indeed, more than this
I could scarcely have ventured upon, because I had not
travelled with any idea of writing on the subject, and the
notes I had kept were therefore scanty, although sufficient,
with a vivid recollection of so much calculated to impress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
to enable me to describe, as far as description is perhaps
desirable. We saw much, and might have seen more
within the time, but it was necessary to avoid fatigue.</p>

<p class="p2">The descriptions contained in the following pages are
therefore to be regarded not as finished pictures, but rather
as the scenes of a moving panorama, exhibiting in succession
views of the more salient points in the various places
to which the reader will be taken, and depicted according to
the fashion of such scenes, too roughly to bear close inspection
or minute criticism.</p>

<p class="p2">When people were compelled to travel slowly, they could
take with them, and had time to read and digest full narratives
of all they were about to see. It was by no means
impossible to carry in the lumbering carriage, or to read
during the leisurely journey, a whole library of such
voluminous and now forgotten books as the <i>Modern Traveller</i>.
But the rapidity of railway travelling has changed even the
character of the guide-book, which, with more copious and
complete information, has been so clipped and condensed, been
made so concisely and methodically useful,&mdash;such a veritable
<i>multum in parvo</i>,&mdash;that every other virtue is forgotten, and to
take up a volume of Bædeker in order to beguile an hour,
or even to obtain a general notion of a place, would be one
of those freaks of which wise men are not readily guilty.</p>

<p>People are therefore more than ever thrown upon reading
of a different description; and notwithstanding the various
books which have been published upon the Riviera, and the
still larger list of those upon Italy, I think none of them,
so far as I have seen, are exactly on the same lines as the
present. It is, indeed, not a little noticeable that so many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
in writing upon Italy, should have chosen to wrap their
descriptions in some strange, weird story. In <i>Corinne ou
L’Italie</i>, Madame de Staël depicts an exotic Scotch nobleman
wildly drawn about from one part of Italy to another
by a most extraordinary platonic love for an Italian improvisatrice,
in order that the different localities may obtain
description. The <i>Improvisatore</i> of Hans Christian Andersen,
with a difference of mode, is much upon the same model for
the same purpose, the machinery by which the hero is blown
hither and thither being much more prominent than the
places upon which he alights. The <i>Transformation</i> of Hawthorne,
in order to describe Rome, forces us into strange
scenes and into company with a mysterious ‘faun’ and
a beautiful murderess; while <i>Romola</i>, by George Eliot,
in describing Florence, drags us after a smooth-faced,
smooth-tongued, heartless villain, who attains to power
with an odd facility, and after blasting a lovely life, is, to
every reader’s relief, tragically removed from the world.
Even Ruffini’s <i>Dr. Antonio</i>, commencing amidst placid
scenes with all the softness of a <i>pastorale</i>, terminates by
breaking hearts, and in the din of a revolution, with guns
crashing and roll of death-dealing musketry on the streets
of Naples.</p>

<p>Amongst its many deficiencies, the present volume is
undoubtedly wanting in this sensational element of
popularity.</p>

<p>Neither, on the other hand, can it lay claim to the merit
of filling the place either of the guide-book or of the
medical adviser. Its chief utility may be in giving in a
general way to those designing to go abroad for a period of
time, some knowledge which may perhaps aid them where
to go and what to see; while there is furnished for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
benefit of novices, in the preliminary chapters, some practical
information, which the experienced traveller, who knows it
all and could state it much better, will be graciously pleased,
if so inclined, to skip.</p>

<p class="p2">In revising at home what was written abroad, I have
studied to ensure accuracy of statement, and have been
rather surprised, on comparing authorities, to find how
widely they frequently differ regarding matters involving
figures, so much so that occasionally I have withheld any
statement on the subject. Some of these discrepancies I
have noticed.</p>

<p class="p2">Accurate ideas of places can be best formed with the aid
of the pictorial art. A book of this nature is susceptible
of endless illustration, and but for adding to the bulk and
the expense, there could have been no difficulty in illustrating
every page of the travels. I have preferred selecting
a few subjects, nearly all from my own sketches, which have
been lithographed by Waterston of Edinburgh. That of the
Estrelles is from a sketch in colours by a lady friend.</p>

<p>Of these illustrations, Mentone has carried off the lion’s
share, and perhaps rightly, because of all the places of
health resort visited by us, we conceived it to be the most
charming, and it was in the winter-time our headquarters.
There are those who prefer Cannes, Hyères, Bordighera, or
San Remo. Even Alassio may become a favourite residence.
But it was our opinion that Mentone unites to a
well-sheltered, dry, sunny, winter climate (which is, however,
not suitable for all invalids), the most beautiful and
picturesque scenery, the most delightful walks and excursions,
with a fascinating rurality which, I fear, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
natives, looking at the matter from a French point of view,
are bent on destroying, by way of raising it up as a sort
of rival in gaiety to such places as Nice. There is one
drawback, in its proximity to the Monte Carlo gambling
tables. But to those who can resist temptation, a trip to
Monte Carlo&mdash;a bright, beautiful, sunny spot, clean and
tidy, with its tropical gardens, its broad terraces, flanked
by elegant white stone balustrades&mdash;is only an additional
attraction; while the adjoining unique peninsula of Monaco,
running out into the sea from the mountains of the <i>Tête de
Chien</i>, and crowned by its palace, its fortifications, its
dwellings, its trees, is one of the many attractive points
which, combined with the beautiful blue of the Mediterranean,
lend such a charm to this part of the Riviera.</p>

<p class="p2">This book would probably never have been written had
it not been begun and all but completed abroad, while in
the sunshine of gladness and hope. Looking to the cause
of our travels, it was unavoidable that I should mention
at its close how sadly all hopes were crushed. But I have
striven as far as possible to eschew the introduction of all
merely personal allusions. I feel, however, I must take
this opportunity of thanking the members of the legal body
to which I belong, and of which I had, at the time it
became advisable to leave home, the honour of being
chief office-bearer, for their courtesy to me then, and for
the heartfelt sympathy which so many of them have since
expressed. I would only say to them as to others, that we
have had of late not a few examples of valued friends who,
long after it became really necessary, have toiled, and
fagged, and wearied their brains out in the pursuit of an
anxious and laborious profession till they have spent their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
last days or years in utter prostration. Better far, when
they can, to obtain thorough relaxation in the enjoyment of
a year, or even two years, of Continental travel over such
interesting ground as in this book I have attempted in
some small measure to describe.</p>

or even of one hundred years hence, how strangely new to
him everything would appear! Events succeed each other
in these times with such startling rapidity, that he would
be a bold man who would venture to predict what even a
generation will bring forth. We may speculate on the
effects likely to result from agencies now in operation,&mdash;as
to what, for example, may be the future of Great Britain,
looking to the gigantic scale on which hazardous enterprise
is carried on; to the contests of labour with capital in
which natural laws are set at defiance; to the growth of
Ritualism in the English Church; to the penchant which
our rulers seem to have for annexing or conquering remote
provinces, stern and wild or insalubrious; to a thousand
other things which are with more or less force influencing
or disquieting our country commercially, socially, or politically,&mdash;but
none of us can possibly foresee the actual consequences
and the condition of things to which they will
lead. In the future there is so much dependent on occurrences
which appear to us to be fortuitous (though truly
under the guidance of Supreme Wisdom), that we can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
feel that over all there hangs an impenetrable veil of
mysterious darkness. A single unexpected event may turn
aside the policy of an age, or even alter the divisions of
the world. A single man by a foolish blunder may plunge
nations into protracted war. A single happy discovery, a
single clever invention, may affect the fortunes or alter
the habits of a whole people. A single convulsion of nature
may change the aspect of a state. But when we turn from
the future to the past, the case is different, and we can
pretty well realize what the feelings of one who has lived,
say, sixty years ago would be if he could now return to
earth. It would, indeed, be some time ere he would begin
to grasp the extent of the wonderful changes which, since he
formerly lived, have been effected. But of all the changes
flowing from the inventions and discoveries which the long
peace succeeding Waterloo was instrumental in producing,
he would probably be most struck by the revolution accomplished
in the matter of travelling.</p>

<p>We have only to go back half a century to the time when
a tour upon the Continent of Europe was attended by great
expense, inconvenience, and even danger. It consumed
much time, and no Englishman upon whom business did
not lay a necessity to travel, could undertake any very
extensive pilgrimage in these foreign countries unless possessed
of ample means united to ample leisure. It was
thus generally reserved for young noblemen and gentlemen
of wealth, as the completion of their education, to take,
with a tutor, a courier, and a sufficient retinue, the grand
tour of Europe, the limit of which was usually, though not
always, Constantinople. I suppose this circumstance has
given rise to the Continental idea, which at least formerly
prevailed, that every Englishman was a <i>milord Anglais</i>, and
to its practical consequence, from which present travellers
continue to suffer&mdash;the custom, gradually disappearing, of
charging English persons upon a different scale from that
applied to natives. No doubt many of those men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
former days scattered money profusely, and to a certain
extent their successors continue to do so, and are even
exceeded by some of the American travellers who, accustomed
to pay in dollars where shillings with us often
suffice, contrive by their extravagance to spoil for others
the places they frequent.</p>

<p>Times are now changed since the days of our grandfathers.
The treacherous sailing vessel (the smack, which
would take at one time three days, and at another, because
of adverse winds, three weeks to go from Leith to London)
is supplanted by the steady, expeditious, and almost faultlessly
punctual steamboat; while the lumbering diligence
or almost equally lumbering post-chaise has been driven
out of the field by, wherever it exists, the rapid railway
train. Nevertheless, as regards Continental railway rapidity,
M. Arago’s expectations that Parisians might ‘on the same
day examine the preparations of our squadron at Toulon;
may breakfast on juicy rougets at Marseilles; may bathe
at mid-day their relaxed limbs in the mineral waters of
Bagnères, and return in the evening by way of Bordeaux
to attend a ball or the Opera House,’<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> have hardly as
yet, at least, been realized; for the railway train abroad
bears about the same proportion in point of speed to the
English train as the clumsy diligence did of old to our
high-flyers and our ten-mile-an-hour stage-coaches.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sometimes,
indeed, people in former times, who were able to
do so, travelled on the Continent in pursuit of health; and
a very interesting account of a tour of this description,
made to a large extent over the same ground as that
which forms the subject of description in the following
pages, is contained in <i>The Diary of an Invalid</i>, by Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Matthew, A.M., made during a journey, performed in the
years 1817-18-19, through Italy, Switzerland, and France,
from which an idea of the difference of travelling in
those days&mdash;sixty years ago&mdash;from what it is now, may
to some extent be gathered. Since the introduction of
railways, which now form a complete network all over the
Continent of Europe, reaching some of its wildest parts, and
not hesitating even to penetrate some of its loftiest mountains,
and often by means of costly tunnels connecting long
stretches of country, travelling has been made so easy, and
the facilities for availing themselves of the means of locomotion
have been rendered so great, that there are comparatively
few persons of the better classes who have not at some time
or other, and in a greater or lesser measure, visited Continental
lands. Our very mechanics have, especially by
means of excursion trains, sometimes in connection with
such great occasions as foreign Exhibitions, been enabled
to see a little of other lands; and even the seeing a little of
another land is calculated to remove prejudices, to enlarge
the ideas, and to extend the amount of one’s information.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>People in the present day travel sometimes for pleasure
and to obtain acquaintance with what cannot be seen at home,
and sometimes for the sake of health; and it is astonishing
to what an extent this latter reason has operated on the
people of Great Britain, who rush from the rigours of their
northern climate&mdash;its clouds, its fogs, and its rains&mdash;to
enjoy the sunshine of warmer places, avoiding and exchanging
wet, foggy, and chilly winter quarters at home for
pleasant sunny places abroad. So much is this the case,
that whole colonies of English people, many of them owning
houses, built or bought for their residence, are found
scattered over the Continent, particularly on the shores of
the Mediterranean Sea. They go to winter there, and the
places they frequent become remarkably English in their
habits and in their language&mdash;the force of the English
character, and still more of the English money, bearing
down and upon the native population. Indeed, it may
rather be said that towns have been built by or for the
occupation of the English&mdash;as, for example, Cannes, which, if
it do not altogether owe its existence, is acknowledged by
the natives to owe its new creation, its growth and extent,
to Lord Brougham.</p>

<p class="p2">We had on various previous occasions taken a summer’s
run abroad. The protracted visit we paid to the Continent
which forms the subject of this volume was dictated
by considerations of health; but we combined with
it, and advantageously, even for that end, some tours of
pleasure. The countries visited by us on this occasion
were France, Italy, and Switzerland; and it is with special
reference to them that the remarks offered in this and
the succeeding introductory chapters apply. I propose in
this chapter to deal shortly with some of the bugbears
which frighten many from crossing the Channel, to state
some of the peculiarities of foreign travel, and to note a
few other matters with which those new to the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
may find it useful to be acquainted previous to setting
out.</p>

<p class="p2">The first great stumbling-block in the way of going
abroad is to many, especially elderly persons, the want of
knowledge of the language of the country to which they
wish to direct their steps, or the want of power to converse
in it freely.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that it is of great consequence to
have an acquaintance with the language of the country in
which one desires to travel or reside for a time. People are
saved much inconvenience and often money when they can
talk it with fluency, and can comprehend what the natives
say&mdash;usually the more difficult operation. At the same time,
in all frequented parts of France, Italy, and Switzerland,
either English or French will carry any one through. French
is spoken by nearly every educated person who travels on
the Continent, with perhaps the exception of the Germans,
who, though they may know a little French, seem to give a
preference to the acquisition of the English language, in
which frequently they converse with great purity and ease.
At the hotels, the landlord, or one of the waiters, sometimes
all of them, can speak English more or less perfectly.
Nay, what is very surprising is, that the man sometimes
called <i>portier</i>, who sits in a little chamber at the door,
has often a better acquaintance with English than even
landlord or waiter. This porter or, as he is more correctly
designated, <i>concierge</i>, is attached to all large hotels, and his
ostensible duty is not that of carrying luggage (for which
business there are men of a different stamp under him),
but consists in keeping the keys of the rooms, attending
to letters, and answering inquiries. In reality he is a man
of superior intelligence, and acts often as the interpreter
of the house; for he is generally acquainted with many
languages, and usually with at least French, English, and
German, and has to reply to questions in these different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
languages almost in the same breath. In frontier places, his
acquaintance is extended to the language of the neighbouring
country&mdash;it may be, for instance, Italian or Spanish.
However, among employees and others with whom the
traveller has to do, the knowledge of many languages is not
confined to the <i>gens portier</i>. At Mentone I was informed
that a hairdresser there could speak five languages; and how
else could he hope, from a hairdresser’s point of view, to
please his patients? At Rome, having gone to the wrong
shop, I had to experience the difficulties of undergoing an
operation by a gentleman of the fraternity who could speak
nothing but Italian; and we should never have succeeded in
coming to a mutual understanding, but for the kindly intervention
of a priest who was being shaved and could speak
French, and after all it did not wholly save me from that
‘croppiness’ in which the foreign <i>coiffeur</i> delights. This
linguistic faculty does not stop at hairdressers, who may be
considered to be men of an advanced race. At Mentone we
used to employ a donkey girl, who also could speak a little
in five languages. Philippina was a bright, intelligent girl,
much liked by her employers, and no doubt she found her
advantage in knowing something of their different tongues.
In Switzerland, for the most part, the German language prevails,
and it is occasionally uncommonly hard, if one is not
acquainted with German or has but a smattering of it, to get
on, say, with a coachman who knows nothing else. At
Ragatz, where they speak German, I put a question to a
stallkeeper selling goods on the street, and was promptly
answered by a young girl of the adjoining stall in English.
I asked her how she came to know English. She learnt it
at school. Were they all taught English, I asked. ‘Oh, no;
those who desired to be taught had to pay for it.’ The
shopkeepers abroad, however, have in many cases acquaintance
with English sufficient to enable them to effect sale of
their wares. They quickly discover us to be English, and
when they speak our language they like to air it, and answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
questions put in their, the shopkeepers’ language (made, we
imagine, with all correctness of expression and of accent), in
our own. In Rome we found that all the cab-drivers could
speak French, which, of course, facilitates going about to those
who cannot speak much Italian. In Italy generally, unless
it might be in speaking to women-servants, and not even
always in their case, we did not find much necessity for using
Italian. Either French or English was in most places understood.
Sometimes we have even had English landladies, as
at the Grand Hotel in Sienna, and at the Tramontano at
Sorrento; but this is a species of good fortune, telling on
the English traveller’s comfort in many ways, which is seldom
to be enjoyed. It only suggests that other English women
might find Italy a good field for similar enterprise.</p>

<p class="p2">In former days the passport system was a difficulty which
afflicted the minds of timorous travellers. Apart from the
surveillance implied, there was the trouble and expense of
procuring it, and having the proper <i>visas</i> affixed by the representatives
of Continental Governments; the anxiety lest in
passing some corner of a foreign territory&mdash;some debateable
land&mdash;it might not be <i>en règle</i>; the detentions it occasioned,
and the perturbation of spirit which arose, should it by any
accident have been mislaid or lost, there being no absolute
certainty that if imprisoned in a cold, damp, dreary
dungeon for want of the necessary safe-conduct, our
Government after a suitable period of fruitless negotiation
would go to war with the foreign power for the defaulter’s
release. On one occasion (in 1855), on entering Geneva by
diligence, I missed my passport (which on arrival I found
lying at my feet), and did not know what would happen, but
the man in collecting passports from the passengers fortunately
overlooked me. This was a species of the rarest
good luck, upon which of course it was utterly impossible to
reckon; and the passport system was one which was felt by
people living in a land in which every one is free, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
inquiry of any kind, to travel where and when he pleases,
to be an intolerable annoyance. It is still maintained;
but with a view, I presume, not to discourage English
travelling (a source of immense profit to the natives),
a British subject has only on passing a frontier to declare
his nationality, and he is at once passed through, except at
some places where he is asked for his carte-de-visite; and if
he have not one at hand, even this is not insisted on if it be
apparent that he is what he represents himself to be, <i>un
Anglais</i>, or, what is the same thing to them, an American.
Yet a passport is sometimes useful; it now costs little, and
should always be taken. It is easily got under the directions
contained in Bradshaw’s <i>Continental Guide</i>, and the
<i>visas</i> of the foreign consuls seem now to be unnecessary, at
least for the countries in which we were to travel. It is
particularly important in some towns, to facilitate the obtaining
of registered letters. Even ordinary letters occasionally,
as I have found (1872) at Brussels on a former trip (having
unfortunately lost my passport at Strasburg), will scarcely
be delivered at the Poste Restante without production of the
passport or other presumable evidence of identity; and it is
said in guide-books, although we have never experienced
the benefit of the information, that it operates as an admission
to certain places of public resort.</p>

<p>Although to the <i>mens conscia recti</i> it may matter little,
it does not follow that, with all this relaxation of former
rigour, people are altogether free from surveillance. The
spy may not crop up here and there as, according to Doyle,
he did, to afflict Messrs. Brown, Jones, and Robinson, yet
travellers do meet with evidences of the existence of a
secret and prying police. At Aix-les-Bains, which, however,
may be regarded as a frontier town, we found the
register of visitors kept in a book furnished by the police,
and containing instructions for the entry of all names
and particulars; and almost everywhere, immediately upon
arrival at a hotel, a waiter comes to take down the name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
address, profession, etc., which, apart from police regulations,
is only proper.</p>

<p class="p2">Besides a passport, there are other things to be attended to
in order that the way may be made smooth.</p>

<p class="p2">People do not always, when they resolve to travel, sit
upon their boxes&mdash;I mean, of course, metaphorically; yet in
travelling abroad, at least for a period of any duration, some
thought must be bestowed upon the <i>impedimenta</i>, and it is
very proper to take such boxes as will stand the immense
fatigue to which all luggage is exposed, and to which the
foreign system of registration greatly adds. Very little
regard is paid by porters to the conservation of the luggage.
It is tossed and dragged along over iron-bound tables; and
huge heavy iron-bound and iron-cornered American chests,
with their piercing little iron castors, are often thrown or
deposited remorselessly on the top of smaller and weaker
packages. Very small articles, indeed, should never be put
in the vans. It is better, and in the long run cheaper, to
have fewer packages and of a larger size. At the same time,
they are very inconvenient if unwieldily large, as too often
one sees them to be, requiring two men for their carriage,
and needing to be left outside the bedroom&mdash;an inconvenience
both to the traveller herself and her fellow-travellers;
for it is the ladies who are in this respect the great transgressors.
Some ladies seem to travel with their whole wardrobe,
or at all events with a useless number of changes of
raiment. On one occasion we met a gentleman and lady,
who had with them nine huge boxes, nearly filling up the
top of a large omnibus, besides smaller articles, including
their maid’s modest provision. This is a grievous mistake.
Ladies ought to travel with the least possible quantity of
changes. More than is fairly needful is inconvenient in
many ways. Apart from causing detentions to others, it is a
source of anxiety, and is most expensive in countries where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the luggage is all weighed, and every pound or extra pound
must be paid for.</p>

<p>Among the little things to be taken, no good traveller will,
of course, omit a pocket corkscrew and a flask of cognac;
nor will he neglect soap. If he have not made it a rule
in all travelling to use his own soap, he is charged at
foreign hotels 1 franc for <i>savon</i>. I have heard a man
growling over the ‘imposition,’ but it served him right, while
the article was just sold to him like anything else, with the
usual 200 or 300 per cent. hotel profit added.</p>

<p>We considered it advisable, especially in view of travelling
in Italy, where the water is said to be often impure,
and consequently unsafe to drink, to take with us a small
filter; but although we used our filter occasionally, I cannot
say we were frequently conscious of drinking bad water.
It is, however, a proper precaution, as water may be bad
without betraying its quality by the taste. An Ashantee
filter with a quart tin bottle, to be had from Atkins and Co.,
62 Fleet Street, London, occupies little space, and costs 8s.
Were Messrs. Atkins to devise a portable little filter for use
at the table by insertion in a tumbler, so as to purify the
drinking water without the fuss of a large filter, which it
is inconvenient to carry, and which one cannot bring to the
public room, it would be of much use. It must be borne in
mind, however, that filters do not destroy organic matter
suspended in the water, and for this purpose permanganite
of potash may be employed. A drop or two of a
solution of this substance, which may be purchased in
dry grains at any chemist’s (easily dissolved when wanted),
effects destruction of organic matter, but gives so unpleasant
a bitterness to the flavour of the water that we scarcely ever
used it.</p>

<p class="p2">There are, however, things more important to provide, and
among them are good guide-books. The rapid growth and
extraordinary ramifications of the railway system have created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a new branch of literature in the railway time-tables. It is
curious to take up an early copy of Bradshaw, consisting
only of a few pages, small pocket size, neatly got up, and to
contrast it with English Bradshaw of the present time. If
such a book be needful in Great Britain, people are even more
helpless without it abroad. Bradshaw’s <i>Continental Guide</i>,
special edition, will always be found to be most useful, both
as a preparatory and as an accompanying handbook. It
contains a great deal of information, which, however, ought
to be taken in a general way, or as the lawyers say, <i>cum nota</i>.
Perfect reliance cannot always be placed upon the accuracy of
its railway and other time-tables and its tariffs. On arriving
in a country, it is especially necessary to secure, in addition,
one of its latest official railway guides. In France there is
published once a week, on the Sundays, <i>L’Indicateur des
Chemins de fer et de la Navigation service officielle</i>. This
costs 60 centimes (6d.), and is a long folio of inconvenient
size. As nearly all French travellers purchase a copy when
they start on a journey, it doubtless obtains a large sale.
The <i>Livret Chaix Spécial pour France</i> (there is another edition
for Europe generally) is an official guide of a more convenient
size. It is published once a month, book shape duodecimo,
costs 1 franc, and has no advertisements, which are scattered
through the <i>Indicateur</i> in a tormenting way, though sometimes
useful when desired information is thereby discovered,
which it might much more readily be if, as in Bradshaw, all
the advertisements were thrown systematically to the end of
the book. It is, however, troublesome to follow these French
guides when divergence from the main lines is desired to be
made. The lines are cut up into fragments without the
references contained in Bradshaw to other pages where
the connecting railways occur, and the neat little well-engraved
maps in the <i>Livret Chaix</i> do not bear, as in Bradshaw’s
map, the page references where the tables of the
railways are to be found. Bradshaw is puzzling enough, but
sometimes it is felt that the <i>Livret Chaix</i> is one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mysteriously-arranged productions ‘which no fella can
understand.’</p>

<p>In Italy there is published once a month, costing 1
franc or lira, <i>L’Indicatore Ufficiale</i>. This is peculiarly
arranged, and requires study; but the Italian lines are so
few, compared with those of France, that there is no
insuperable difficulty in discovering the time-bills of particular
railways. The Italian <i>Indicatore</i> contains various
preliminary directions which it is well to read. They are
curious, and embrace, <i>inter alia</i>, regulations relative to the
transport of cats and monkeys.</p>

<p>The Italians have also a long <i>Indicatore</i> similar to the
French weekly one; and in both countries smaller and
cheaper district guides, with more limited information, are
to be had.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, a <i>Guide des Voyageurs en Suisse</i> is published,
apparently twice a year&mdash;at least those procured in the
Swiss travelling season are marked ‘Saison d’été,’ 1877 or
1878, as the case may be.</p>

<p>It is never safe to trust to a guide of a past month,
although changes are generally only made in the beginning
of the winter season, or about 15th or 16th October, and in
the beginning of the summer or spring season. By not
observing a change of this kind which had just been made,
we were detained at Toulon for three or four hours waiting
for the next train to Hyères.</p>

<p>Although it is not desirable to burden oneself with
many books in travelling, Bædeker’s Guide-Books, which
on the whole are very accurate and useful, ought not to
be dispensed with. Italy is embraced in three little
volumes&mdash;Northern, Central, and Southern; and Bædeker
has separate Guides to Switzerland, France, and other
countries; so that if one has to travel much, quite a little
library requires to be taken. Bædeker’s Northern Italy,
however, embraces the Riviera di Ponente, in which Cannes
and Mentone are, and the journey thither from Paris, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
towns on the way, such as Lyons, Avignon, Nismes, and
Marseilles, while southward it extends as far as Florence.
Murray’s Guide-Books are very useful, and are much
more full and detailed, but consequently are more bulky,
and are therefore more suitable for protracted visits to
a town such as Venice. Neither Bædeker nor Murray,
however, are to be wholly relied upon, especially for the
latest information. For example, we found in Italy that
while it is said in Bædeker there are no fees to pay, in the
different Academie delle Belle Arti there is now charged
1 franc per person for admission. I would add, also, that
Bædeker’s estimates of hotel charges can by no means
be relied on as exact, although they may at one time
have been so, or they may in some cases be those with
which Germans are charged, Bædeker being a publication
originating in Germany.</p>

<p>These books all require from time to time careful revision;
and considering the importance to the traveller of having
the latest information, and the large sale they command,
they ought to be revised at short intervals.</p>

<p>There are certain very useful guide-books published in
France, of two sorts&mdash;the <i>Guides Diamant</i>, which are little
pocket volumes in small type; and the <i>Guides Grand Format</i>,
which are of a larger size. Each class (published only in
French) contains a series of volumes applicable to the
different parts of France, as well as volumes devoted to
other countries. The divisional volumes for France are
exceedingly useful, as containing detailed information
respecting the districts to which they apply.</p>

<p>I may also mention that Mr. Cook, the tourist, publishes
a series of handbooks for the countries to which his tours
apply; and that recently Black has also added to his list of
guide-books, guides to the south of France.</p>

<p>To those visiting Rome, <i>Hare’s Walks in Rome</i> (2 vols.)
will be found extremely serviceable. Unfortunately we did
not take it with us, as adding to the quantity of books with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which we had to travel. It is a little heavy to carry about
in the hand, but it directs attention to what is best worth
seeing, and may be consulted at one’s lodgings before and
after visiting the attractions of Rome.</p>

<p>In the old coaching days, when the mail or the diligence
drove through a town, and generally stopped at one of the
principal inns, there was not much deliberation needed or
even much choice granted as to where the passenger should
sleep. But it is one of the inconveniences attendant upon
the railway system,&mdash;to a certain extent obviated by the
erection of station hotels,&mdash;that he has not an opportunity
from ocular inspection beforehand, on arriving at a strange
town, of forming an idea as to where he should go. And it
is an observation on Bradshaw (more or less applicable to
other guide-books), that it does not do to rely implicitly on
its recommendations of hotels,&mdash;a circumstance which probably
arises from the notice of given hotels having been
written years previously, and means not having been used
to obtain a complete revision from year to year. More
reliance in this respect is to be placed on Bædeker’s Guide-Books.
Hotels marked by Bædeker with an * will almost
always be found of a good character. In the absence of
other means of intelligence, we have sometimes been driven,
like many others, to ask information from chance fellow-travellers,
at other times to get it at the hotel from which
we started in the morning&mdash;not infrequently the less trustworthy
method of the two. But as it is most desirable to
have reliable information on this subject, it is, where
practicable, by far the best plan, before setting out upon a
tour, to settle as nearly as possible the route to be taken,
and to obtain a note from friends who have travelled along
it of the hotels they would recommend. In possession of
this knowledge beforehand, all anxiety is removed, and one
is enabled to write previously, requesting the landlord to
retain rooms. Letters and telegrams with such requests
are always carefully attended to, the hotelkeeper no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
considering that application to him is made from choice and
not from chance.</p>

<p class="p2">The great increase of travelling produced by the railways,
has led bankers to contrive convenient methods in
which people may take the requisite supply of money with
them; and of all the methods which have been devised,
the best and safest is that afforded by the system of
circular notes. These notes are granted by certain banks
in London and Edinburgh, and are drafts upon London
for £20 each, or for the usually more convenient amount
of £10 each, according to the tourist’s desire. They can
be cashed at any town on the Continent, hotelkeepers
also accepting them in payment of their bills, but without
benefit of any exchange which would be allowed by
the banks. Along with the notes, the banker delivers
what is called a ‘Letter of Indication,’ which contains a
list of all the banks with which he corresponds, embracing
almost every place which may be visited in Europe. This
letter, for security’s sake, it is advisable to keep in a different
pocket or box from the circular notes, which require his
signature and endorsement. The banker’s correspondents
ought not to cash the notes without production of this letter
of indication; but sometimes they are negligent or lax in this
respect, particularly if the presenter appear to be respectable
or a <i>bona fide</i> traveller. At some places, however, such as at
Paris, the bankers are more cautious, and not only invariably
ask for the letter, but they put sundry questions and take
the hotel address&mdash;the object being, quite properly, in a quiet
way to make sure that the notes are presented by the right
person. A friend had his notes stolen from him at a railway
station in Paris on arrival from England, having unfortunately
put them with other things in a small hand-bag,
instead of carrying them in a secure pocket about his person.
His letter of indication, however, was not with the notes,
and so far, though not altogether, was he safe. The thief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
took them at once to a bank in Paris, and, I suppose, not
having the letter of indication, and perhaps not being able to
give a satisfactory account of himself, they were forwarded
to London, and within fifteen hours after being stolen were
presented to the banker on whom they were drawn, and they
were refused because the signature attached by the thief did
not correspond with the usual signature of my friend.</p>

<p>These circular notes are exchanged for the money of the
country in which they are presented for payment; but
French gold is always useful, and fetches full value abroad.
In exchanging, one generally gets the benefit of the exchange,
subject to a fractional deduction. The usual exchange in
France for a sovereign is 25 francs 10 centimes;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but this is
seldom got, and in some places, such as Biarritz and Mentone,
the bankers only give the 25 francs nett, and in other places
slightly more or slightly less according to the state of the
exchange. At a bank in Cannes a friend exchanged Bank of
England notes simultaneously with my exchanging a circular
note for £10. While I obtained 7½d. (75 centimes) of premium,
he got nothing, because the banker said there was always much
more trouble about Bank of England notes, which required
registration. Eighteen months later, however, I found in
Paris, oddly enough, that Bank of England notes were at a
premium, while circular notes were at a discount. At Cannes,
in 1877, I had occasion to cash a bank draft on London
received from one of the colonies, and found that nominally
the allowance was greater than upon circular notes; but as
the banker charged a commission, it practically reduced the
exchange to about the same amount. Another notable circumstance
was, that while at Mentone the bankers would give
nothing beyond the 25 francs, at the neighbouring town of
Nice the bankers always gave exchange varying from 75
centimes to 1 franc per £10. At Pau I found that while
the correspondent of the bank only gave ½ franc per £10,
another banker gave 1 franc, and upon an exchange of £50<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
even a shade more. Again, at Montreux, in Switzerland, I
obtained 1 franc 25 centimes per £10, and within little more
than a week afterwards at Biarritz, in accordance with invariable
practice, nothing beyond the 25 francs per £. The same
difference occurred in two other places. Within a similar
short space, I changed in Paris and got 25 francs per £. Within
a day or two afterwards, I had to change other notes at Interlachen,
and received 25 francs 10 centimes. The only explanation
I ever got for these anomalies was that given at Biarritz,
the banker there saying, that at Montreux they were near
the Italian border (in fact, a long way off from it), and could
make more money out of the notes. But this was obviously
an unsatisfactory reason, and certainly could not explain the
position of matters at Mentone, which is within two miles of
the Italian frontier.</p>

<p>In Italy the exchange of gold or notes on London into
Italian paper is a matter of considerable importance to the
holder, for the exchange allowed, though it fluctuates, is
always high.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The lowest we received anywhere was 27·03 at
Rome, 23d March 1877, and at San Remo 1878. The highest
was at Venice, in May 1877, 28·25. This last was during
the Eastern War, which had been declared in April, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
considerably raised the value of gold in Italy. I presume
the uncertainty as to whether Italy would be involved in the
war helped to depress the value of the paper. It is difficult
for one who has not been engaged in commerce or in banking
to understand why these fluctuations occur, or to be acquainted
with the causes which influence them. The current value is
said to be dependent upon the position of the commercial
relations between Great Britain and the Continent; but there
are obviously other circumstances, such as national credit,
political disturbances, war, and the abundance or scarcity of
money, which affect or bias the barometer. But whatever
may be the cause, the traveller obtains the benefit of the
effect when the exchange is high, as his money goes so much
further. The Italian paper money is, unless otherwise specially
bargained for, taken everywhere in Italy&mdash;in hotels, in
shops, and even at railways. It is only necessary to be particular
in seeing that paper of the right sort is given. It is
always safe to receive paper of the National Bank of Italy.
This circulates everywhere throughout Italy, but notes of
district or provincial banks are not accepted out of the province;
and there are certain notes which have been called in
(with which one soon becomes familiar), which, though taken
in shops, are refused at railway stations and other public
places, sometimes provokingly.</p>

<p>One curious circumstance about the Continental banks is,
that they seem to possess marvellously limited stores of
money, whether of notes or of gold and silver. People have
just to take what the bankers can give. I have more than
once been obliged in France to take a note for 1000 francs, or
£40, which is practically useless, unless where residence in a
place is to be of sufficient duration to enable the holder to
tender the note in payment of his hotel bill. I have often
had the greatest difficulty in getting small change even for
half a napoleon. For a napoleon (20 francs) one is fortunate
to get, as a favour from a bank, four large 5 franc pieces, the
banker saying that he has no smaller change, which perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
only means he cannot spare his lesser money. This state of
matters, I believe, arises from the scarcity of silver money
in France, produced by the people hoarding up their savings,
which are thus withdrawn from circulation. In Italy
(where apparently the same hoarding must take place, though
probably not so extensively) I have for the most part had to
take, except to a very limited extent, the notes proffered by
the banks; and one very useful kind of note, that for half a
franc, is very difficult to procure. Even 1 franc notes are
scarce; the bankers will give you a pocketful of copper
instead. These ½ franc and 1 franc notes are essentially
necessary for fees in going about such places as Rome;
but copper is freely taken as payment of fees, carriage drives,
etc. Fancy tendering a London cabman his fare in copper!</p>

<p>At first one feels a little repugnance to the use of these
small Italian notes, which are of all values; but after getting
habituated to them, a preference arises for their use over
metal money, which is so much heavier. A special purse with
divisions for the different values should be procured.</p>

<p class="p2">And now, having accomplished the preparations for the
journey, the next question is as to the route. It will always
be found that there are greater facilities in travelling to and
from a capital city, such as London, Paris, or Edinburgh;
and in going abroad towards France, the voyager has generally
to select one of the routes from London to Paris. The
four great leading steamboat passages across the Straits are&mdash;Southampton
to Havre, advertised to take in crossing
six and a half hours; but on the only occasion on which I
have gone by that route, which was in 1854, the voyage
occupied in a calm night eleven hours, though possibly
more powerful boats are now laid on. Newhaven to
Dieppe, five and a half to six hours in good weather: I
have been nine hours in a storm. Folkestone to Boulogne,
ordinarily two hours, although one fast boat (by which our
last crossing was made) accomplishes the passage in an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and a half. Dover to Calais, one hour forty minutes; but
in a storm I have known it to have taken four hours.
As an inducement to travel by the longer crossings, the fares
are proportionately lower. Fares by night service trains
are considerably less than those by day trains. The routes
by Newhaven and Folkestone are tidal, and the hours of
sailing vary according to the state of the tide, which is
troublesome, and infers to most people, when the boats sail
at an early hour, sleeping at the port of departure, which we
repeatedly have had to do.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The passage by Folkestone and
Boulogne is by many preferred to that from Dover to Calais,
because there is less groundswell. Getting into the pier at
Boulogne is sometimes, owing to the state of the tide, tedious;
but from a statement in the newspapers, it would appear
that the authorities are contemplating the improvement of
the harbour by an outlay of £680,000. In proceeding to
Paris from Calais or Boulogne, one may stop at Amiens and
see the town and fine old cathedral; but the routes from
Havre, and from Dieppe to Paris through Normandy, are far
more interesting by the way, and pass picturesque Rouen,
which is well worthy of a visit, the stoppage of at least
a night to explore it amply repaying the visitor.</p>

<p class="p2">All the world and the railway companies are largely
indebted to the enterprise of Mr. Cook, who, from small
beginnings, commencing in 1851, has gradually enlarged
his schemes for the public benefit, till the ramifications of
his system extend over all Europe and even into the other
continents. Mr. Gaze followed, apparently a good many
years later, and his arrangements seem to be on an equally
extensive scale. Both houses have agencies in the leading
towns of Great Britain, as well as in several of the principal
European cities. Their success is evidence of their utility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and there can be no doubt that the facilities afforded by
them have greatly increased the number of Continental
travellers. Their Lists furnish the routes and the cost of
travel; their tickets are extremely useful, and possess the
advantage of being printed in English as well as in the language
of the country to which they apply; while to those who
are afraid of travelling in countries where they cannot speak
the language, their conducted tours are no doubt valuable.</p>

<p>Tickets can be got from Cook’s offices to Paris <i>via</i> Dover
and Newhaven; Gaze supplies tickets <i>via</i> Folkestone and
Southampton; and there is a little advantage in taking these
tickets, in respect of saving time and trouble at the bustling
London railway stations. The tickets are made up in little
books, and a leaf applicable to the portion traversed is
withdrawn by the ticket collector upon accomplishment of
that stage of the journey. But if the traveller be going
beyond Paris, to some place to which these offices book, he
receives a separate packet of tickets, which is exceedingly
useful to him, as, besides saving the trouble of purchasing
at the Paris railway station, he is enabled on starting from
Paris to register his heavy luggage to any part of his destination
for which there is a coupon, and that even at every
such place. For example, going from Paris to Nice, the
luggage may be registered to Nice; and taking sufficient in
the carriage for the journey, in a <i>sac-de-nuit</i>, one may stop
or break his journey at Dijon, Lyons, Avignon, Marseilles,
Cannes, and some other towns. He can be a month on the
road, and find upon arrival at Nice his luggage safe in the
luggage room, with a trifle per night to pay for the accommodation.
The trouble of procuring tickets at each station
is also saved, although at some places they require the
tickets to be stamped afresh at the ticket window; but in
Italy generally a separate window for this purpose is provided,
so that the trouble of obtaining the <i>visa</i> is there
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The tickets issued by the two London houses for France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seem to be charged at or about the same rates as at the
French railway stations. But in Italy, or for Italy, their
tickets must be paid for in English money; so that it does
not seem in a pecuniary point of view to be one’s interest
to procure them, because the benefit of the exchange, amounting
to about one-twelfth of the cost, is thus lost. No doubt
it is an advantage to those who cannot speak a few words of
the Italian language so as to be understood, or who cannot
pick up what is said at the railway booking window, to take
the English tickets, and they can afford to pay for their ignorance.
But if the fee-expecting <i>commissionaire</i> of the hotel do
not attend to the matter, which he often of his own accord
does, or will do if asked, extremely little is necessary to be
said, even French, or a mere acquaintance with the numerals,
being generally sufficient. Personally I never experienced
any difficulty whatever in taking out the tickets at the foreign
railway stations, and indeed the only difficulty I remember
to have had was, because I had Cook’s tickets. Conceiving
there might, on a first visit, be trouble, I had at Nice taken
tickets from Genoa to Rome, bearing a right to make three
intermediate stoppages. Having, in perfect accordance with
the conditions, stopped at Spezzia, Pisa, and Sienna, I could
hardly, on leaving Sienna, get the tickets marked for Rome.
They were refused at the ticket window, and doubted by the
<i>chef-de-gare</i>; and it was only upon my emphatic remonstrance,
and his appealing to somebody else on the platform,
that I succeeded in getting them stamped. On arriving in
Rome, I told Mr. Cook’s agent there what had happened, and
he said that if I had been required to have purchased tickets
from Sienna to Rome, he would have compelled the railway
company to have refunded the money, and made a complaint
about it. It was no doubt just one of those stupid things that
will happen under the best arrangements, well to be mentioned,
that it may not be repeated; and apart from the question of
time (for the English tickets are limited in time allowed for
a journey extending over several towns), there is no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
why they should not be preferred, provided always that
they could be procured with Italian paper money. Probably
from the fluctuating state of the exchange, it is difficult for
Messrs. Cook and Gaze to arrange; but if they could, it would
obviate all objection.</p>

<p class="p2">To those intending to travel in Italy, great advantages are
held out by the railway companies in the shape of circular
tour tickets (<i>viaggi circulari</i>). The <i>Indicatore della Strada
Ferrata</i> contains a list,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with plans of a large number of such
tours, the tickets for which are issued, enduring, according
to the length of tour, from ten to sixty days (which cannot
be extended), at the large reduction of 45 per cent. upon the
price which would otherwise be exigible. One of these tours
is, for example, a complete round of Italy&mdash;from Turin by
the west coast, embracing Florence and Rome to Naples,
and thence by the east coast by Ancona, Bologna, Venice,
Milan, and back to Turin, at a cost for first class of £7, 17s.,
and second and third classes correspondingly low. This
tour, for which sixty days are allowed, enables the traveller
to stop at any important town on the lines; and all that is
necessary is, at starting from each place, to get the next
station at which he means to stop scored through at the
railway window. To those whose time is limited, these
circular tickets are valuable, and they are procurable with
Italian paper, so that the benefit of exchange is got. Cook
and Gaze issue tickets for the same circular tours, and probably
at the same price, although I suppose they are generally
in connection with tickets from London; but they have,
I understand, to be paid for in English money. They possess
the advantage, I believe, by no means to be undervalued, of
having all directions printed in English as well as Italian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The railway companies issue their tickets at every important
town on the line of route to be travelled.</p>

<p>In France, likewise, there are for some parts circular tours,
such as from Paris to Bordeaux, Biarritz, the Pyrenees and
back. Information on the subject may be got in the <i>Indicateur</i>,
or in the <i>Guides Diamant</i> among the advertisements.</p>

<p>I would just add in connection with this subject, that it
is said by Bradshaw that return tickets are ‘almost universal
abroad, and issued upon terms far more liberal than any
granted by our English lines.’ Although I have on various
occasions taken day return tickets for short trips, I have
never yet found them to be any cheaper than the double fare.</p>

<p class="p2">In the course of a journey, what are called supplementary
billets can be procured through the guard, so as to enable
a neighbouring place to be visited by a side line. Thus, in
going from Lyons to Marseilles, we obtained supplementary
tickets from Tarascon to Nismes by asking for them when
stopping at Valence, about the second station before reaching
Tarascon. This, especially looking to the peculiarities
of foreign lines, is a great convenience.</p>

<p>The Italian <i>Indicatore</i> states that travellers may exchange
at any place to a higher class by paying difference of fare
between the place at which the transfer is effected and the
terminus.</p>

<p class="p2">After crossing the Channel, the first thing which is new
to one who has not previously ventured out of the British
Islands, is the examination of luggage by the <i>douaniers</i> or
custom-house officers. It is now arranged that by registration
of luggage to Paris, the examination may take place
there. This saves detention at the port of debarkation. In
general, an Englishman, if apparently a <i>bona fide</i> pleasure
traveller, is very easily dealt with by these officers. If he
have but a single portmanteau, it is sometimes not so much
as opened, or if opened, there is but a nominal examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He is asked if he have anything to declare&mdash;’Any cigars?’
It is curious that in almost every country, the sole special
question usually asked is, ‘Have you any cigars?’ and the
word of an Englishman that he has none is ordinarily taken.
If there be several boxes, the officer points to one of them,
and desires it to be opened, sometimes merely to be closed
again. At other times the man will provokingly put his
hand down to the very depths, and perhaps bring up something
hard or a parcel, and fancy he has made a discovery.
But he is easily satisfied, and things are restored in the best
way possible for a tight fit. No examination of luggage
seems to be made on entering Switzerland from any frontier
country, indicating that the Swiss have no custom-house
duties; but on leaving Switzerland and entering France, there
is a more minute examination than occurs when coming
from England; and although English people get off comparatively
easily, a question being sometimes asked as to
where they are going, those of other countries are most
unmercifully dealt with, every separate package, down even
to handbags, being overhauled. Once, many years ago,
travelling by diligence from Geneva to Lyons, I saw every
article in a French lady’s boxes turned out and minutely
examined at three different places on the way. I presume
they are suspicious of such travellers secreting Geneva
watches or jewellery. On that occasion my own luggage
was only examined once, but they made a sort of examination
of the person by passing their hands over my dress.
The lady, no doubt, was subjected to a more strict examination
of her person.</p>

<p class="p2">On landing in France, it is found that there is a difference
of time between Paris and London of ten minutes. All the
French railways go by Paris time; all Swiss railways, by
Berne time, which is twenty minutes in advance of Paris
time; and all Italian railways, by Roman time, which is forty-seven
minutes in advance of Paris time. This is all very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
right and proper, and makes it easy to know the times for
travelling by railway. But although the railways adopt the
time of their respective capitals, every different town has,
according to its longitude, its own, or what is held to be the
correct time at the place according to the sun. This proves
most embarrassing, more especially as the hotels regulate
their hours by the clock of their own town when that exists.
If not, there is the utmost perplexity in finding out what
the correct time is. At Mentone no two clocks were alike.
By common consent they all differed. On going south to
Avignon, the time is nearly a quarter of an hour in advance
of Paris time; at Mentone it is twenty minutes. If, on the
other hand, the journey be westward of Paris, at Biarritz, the
time will be found as much the other way; so that one of the
first inquiries to be made on reaching a hotel is, ‘What is
the time of the town?’ and to note the difference between
that and railway time.</p>

<p>The complex and extraordinary mode of measuring time
formerly in use in Italy, by counting twenty-four hours for the
varying time of vespers, seems to be now wholly abandoned.</p>

<p class="p2">All who have travelled on the Continent are familiar with
the railway arrangements; but as they differ in some particulars
from those to which we are accustomed, and as this
introductory chapter is mainly intended for the benefit of
those who have not previously crossed the Channel, it may
be useful to mention some of them.</p>

<p class="p2">Although in all leading respects foreigners have copied
our railway system, yet their diverging peculiarities are not
always calculated to reconcile an Englishman to Continental
travel. He arrives at the station, which he finds he must
do in France a full half-hour before the hour of starting; in
Italy, in large towns, a full hour. And in France he must
always, in the first instance, procure his ticket at a little
wire-latticed window, falling into a <i>queue</i> of people to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his turn. Stooping to a small hole not six inches high on
the table level, he has to shout through in French to the
distributor of billets within, telling him what he wants, and
from whom he receives in return mention of the amount to
be paid. It is always well to know beforehand how much
this is, which can be at least approximately calculated from
the time-tables; but the exact price of tickets may usually be
obtained from a board or table of fares near the ticket window,
often most inconveniently placed and arranged, and so dirty
and soiled as occasionally to be illegible. Without a previous
knowledge of the probable cost, it is exceedingly difficult
for a stranger to make out what the man says, owing to
the narrowness of the aperture and the indistinctness of
French pronunciation. In many places, particularly in Italy,
an official is stationed (a most commendable practice) outside
the window, to prevent inconvenient crowding, to tell the
fares, to see that the correct billets are supplied, and to be a
check on the ticket distributor giving the right change.
I have been told of cases where, in Italy,&mdash;but it was some
years ago,&mdash;there had been supposed attempts to cheat on
the part of the distributor; but, except on one occasion, I
never got wrong change. It happened at Bologna, where I
received at the ticket office 1 lira too little, and at the luggage
office some pence less than the correct change. In
both cases it was at once rectified on my pointing out the
mistakes, and I set them down to slips. At other times, on
accidentally neglecting to take up small change at the window,
such as a sou, I have been called back to get it. But
there is an admirable check upon any attempt to cheat, or on
mistakes, in the circumstance that commonly Continental
tickets have marked upon them their cost&mdash;a system which
might with great advantage be introduced into Great Britain.</p>

<p class="p2">And now the Englishman obtains a new experience of how
they manage things abroad. His luggage was, on arrival at
the station, deposited on a long table under the care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
conductor of the omnibus which brought him. This luggage,
with the exception of such little things as he means to take
with him into the carriage, has, when his turn arrives, to be
carefully weighed. In France each traveller is allowed 30
kilogrammes, or about 65 lbs. weight. For every pound
beyond this he is required to pay according to distance.
The men engaged in weighing ask for the railway billets
to show the destination, and then he goes to the luggage-ticket
window, where he duly receives back his billets
stamped as having been used, and gets a little scrap or
morsel of thin paper, which is the receipt for his luggage,
and for which he has in any case to pay 10 centimes (1d.) in
addition to any charge for extra weight. This receipt bears
the number of <i>colis</i> or packages and of persons, the united
weight of the party’s luggage, the sum payable, the place of
despatch and the place of destination, and a printed number;
which number is also affixed to each article so registered, and
is the means by which, on arriving at the journey’s end, it is
identified. What is the exact method by which the officials
in charge manage to secure that all the multiform boxes and
bags arrive at their respective proper destinations, I do not
know. I presume that, in addition to an invoice or list
of some kind accompanying the train, the things for each
station are separately stowed away in the waggons; but
whatever may be the means adopted, they ensure the utmost
regularity, although I have heard of persons losing small
articles, which, as a rule, ought not to be so registered.
On one occasion a rather curious circumstance happened to
my luggage. I went from Interlachen to Paris, and the
registration number on my portmanteau was 82. From
Paris to London it was registered anew, and the number
happened to be 282; but the passage across the Channel
was very stormy, and I presume the Paris number had been
washed off on the voyage. On presenting my receipt at
London, and pointing out my portmanteau, it was found that
it had not the number 282, but simply 82, and I had some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
difficulty in getting it; but as my key opened the lock, and
nobody else appeared to claim the article, I got delivery.</p>

<p>In Italy, no allowance is made for luggage. Every pound
which is registered must be paid for, and consequently it is
not in general necessary previously to take out the railway
billets. The expense is not, however, great, unless one’s
luggage be heavy. Our luggage, which perhaps was less
than many travel with, cost me, travelling nearly all over
Italy, for railway charges, less than 30s. per person; but
railway fares in Italy are cheaper than with us, so that the
difference is thus made up.</p>

<p>Although the system of registration is attended by much
security, and is one with which it might not be safe to
dispense in travelling abroad, I do not think that, in its integrity,
it could be introduced into busy England. We should
never stand the minute weighing of our luggage, and, above
all, the enormous loss of time which it entails. It has,
besides, its disadvantages, because it results in travellers
carrying and placing beside them articles which ought properly
to be in the van. The luggage registered, too, suffers
injury. Moreover, at the journey’s end a great detention
is always occasioned. All have to wait till the vans are
emptied, and the contents dragged about and arranged upon
long tables in a closed room. When the entire collection is
adjusted as far as possible according to the numbers affixed,
the doors of this room are opened, after having had to
wait wearily perhaps half an hour. It is, however, by
no means necessary to attend personally, except where the
luggage must be passed through the <i>douane</i>, and sometimes
the hotel omnibus will take home the passengers and come
back for the luggage; but personal attendance enables a more
prompt recognition of it to be made, and ensures accuracy.
In Italy it is reckoned safer not to leave luggage at a
station. The Italians have not been credited with the
greatest honesty, though probably this is a thing of the past.
However, they themselves manifest the sense of insecurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by refusing to receive luggage for registration which is not
properly locked or fastened, and boxes arriving in such condition
are closed at the owner’s expense in his presence.</p>

<p>In travelling by steamboat, also, a charge is made for
luggage according to weight. Thus, upon a little sail of
about 10 miles on Lake Como, I had to pay 2½ francs for
luggage. In diligences in Switzerland, 20 lbs. weight only is
allowed. All weight beyond this is charged for&mdash;a fairly
reasonable regulation.</p>

<p class="p2">Perhaps the most peculiar and striking of all the Continental
travelling arrangements is the system of waiting-rooms.
It introduces to English people a difference of
method of a somewhat irritating description. The <i>salle-d’attente</i>
is a species of sheep pen into which the traveller is
driven after he has obtained his railway billets and had his
luggage registered, and where he must remain helplessly
shut up till the train by which he is to travel is about to
leave. Generally a separate large room is provided for each
of the three classes of travellers, and the rule is that nobody
is allowed to enter without exhibition of the railway ticket
appropriate to that particular class; and as this cannot be
done till the luggage be registered and paid for, which
seldom takes less than a quarter of an hour, if ladies be of
the party, they must wait with all the patience possible,
guarding the little articles to be taken into the railway carriage,
in the large hall of the office, where ofttimes there is
not a seat or a comfortable or clean one to be had. Once or
twice, in breach of the regulations, I have got them passed
into the waiting-room. In the <i>salle-d’attente</i> itself, penetrated
under burden of all these little <i>impedimenta</i> (for it
is rare good luck to get a porter to help), a crowd of people
all similarly laden is found, and there the passengers have
to wait sometimes for long periods till within four or five
minutes of the starting of the train, when a man opens
the door of the prison-house or menagerie and shouts out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
‘<i>Messieurs les voyageurs, pour</i> (naming the places) <i>en voiture!</i>’
It may happen that there are several such shouts for other
trains before your own is announced, and your sudden preparations
for departure are stopped by the discovery that your
turn has not yet come, and you are not allowed to leave the
place of confinement. When your turn does come, you gather
up your things, which no porter helps you to carry, and rush
pell-mell out with the crowd. There is no servant to tell you
where to go, and your only security not to do wrong is to follow
the multitude. When you reach the carriages, it is seldom
they have any board or placard indicating their destination. If
there should by any chance be an official about, he is not there
for the purpose of directing people; and if you ask him, he
gives about as slender information in answer as possible.
It is folly, however, to stop to ask him in the first instance.
The plan is, trudging on with wraps and bags and all the little
things, to bundle into the first open carriage where there
appears to be sufficient room, and secure seats as best you
can, and then get out and make inquiries for certainty’s sake.
If you do not do so, and a lady, to recover breath, halts an
instant with foot on step before ascending, others will
coolly mount before her and take possession, and there may
be the utmost possible difficulty in procuring seat-room elsewhere,
foreigners being just as selfishly guilty as English
people of telling lies about a carriage being full. At all events,
those who have got in first have probably secured all the
available spaces for their goods and chattels, as well as the
best seats for themselves. To avoid the expense of registration,
or to escape detention on arrival, foreigners (by whom I
mean natives of the Continent) almost invariably, as already
mentioned, bring portmanteaus and other big articles into
the carriages; and as the spaces below the seats are perhaps
purposely narrow and confined, these things become very
inconvenient, often occupying the places presumably intended
for light articles, or they are placed on the seats or
among the feet. If smoking disagrees, or you are averse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it, and desire a non-smoking carriage, the hunt for this in
the scramble is an additional embarrassment; and frequently,
after getting into a carriage and having everything arranged,
the non-smokers discover that the compartment is a smoking
one, and they have to tumble out at the last moment and
endeavour to discover empty places elsewhere. The inconveniences
attendant upon this method of arranging for the
departure of travellers are such as would make it intolerable
in Great Britain, where one walks leisurely to the train as
he arrives and selects his seat, with the aid, it may be, of a
porter or a guard. Free Britons will submit quietly till a
next election to the imposition of heavy burdens in support
of an unnecessary war, but a petty grievance like this would
raise a storm which no board of directors could resist.</p>

<p class="p2">The Continental railways, however, have both porters and
guards, who, like policemen, never seem to be present when
most wanted. On arrival at a station from an hotel, there are
always railway porters to carry the luggage to the registration
table, for which they expect to be paid, and sometimes in
expectation of a further fee they will carry the <i>petits bagages</i>
to the door of the <i>salle-d’attente</i>&mdash;occasionally, though rarely,
into the <i>salle-d’attente</i> itself; but where assistance is more
needed, viz. in leaving the <i>salle-d’attente</i> in the rush for
the train, porters are nowhere, and on arrival of the trains
at their destination, it is by the merest chance (at least in
France) one can be got to carry the unregistered articles&mdash;the
number of which is aggravated by the circumstance
that it seems to be part of the system of registration, that
if luggage be forwarded to a station in advance of that at
which stoppage is to be made for the night or longer, it is
not possible to register separately to the stopping station
what is required for immediate use. A similar difficulty
happens if the heavy luggage is to be left at the railway
station, to be got upon setting out upon the further journey
next day&mdash;a circumstance constantly happening, we ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
having travelled thus for days together. All must be taken
or none. But at some of the larger town stations, there
would now seem to be a left luggage room similar to our
own, where luggage may be deposited on payment of usually
two sous per package per night.</p>

<p>The railway porters always expect a fee (20 centimes per
box, at most, will suffice in France) for moving the heavy
luggage&mdash;even the registration weighers sometimes look for
a copper. In Italy, however, the porters often state there
is a tariff of charge, under which generally 25 centimes each
package is paid, though the amount depends somewhat on
the size of each. It is, however, a comfort to know in
Italy, if you can, what exactly there is to pay; but although
appeal has often been made to the tariff if it happened
to be high, I never was gladdened with a sight of this
mysterious document. I should make one exception, for
the extortion was so great that I demanded to see it, though,
as I might have foreseen, it was worse than useless to do
so. It occurred at Geneva, where a porter exacted 3½ francs
(3s.) from me for transporting on a barrow our luggage
from the steamboat to our hotel close by, we being charged
in the bill in addition 2½ francs for conveying two of us to
the hotel, or 5s. for moving baggage little more than a
hundred yards.</p>

<p>I recollect some years ago a system very equitable both
for porters and passengers was in use at Cologne; a charge,
I think, of 2d. for each package was made at the railway
station for porterage, and the amount dropped into a box,
the contents of which fell to be divided afterwards among
all the porters.</p>

<p>One misses at the foreign railways the fee-expecting,
bustling English guard. There is such a person, but he is
not the important functionary he makes himself at home,
where he is seen going about as if all the carriages belonged
to him. Abroad, the guard arrives not or retreats until
the train is about to start, and the first and perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
only time he makes his appearance is probably after proceeding
a long way on the journey; and when the train is
in full motion, nervous passengers are suddenly alarmed
by seeing a man creeping along the outside of the carriage
and popping his head in at the window, or opening the
door to see the billets, which are seldom examined before
starting. He silently gives the tickets a clip, and disappears,
perhaps to reappear after another 50 miles for another
examination and another clip, the want of inspection
before starting removing a safeguard which exists in
England against proceeding in the wrong train. But if
the guard render himself invisible, he does not expect,
as in England, to be fee’d for making needless announcements,
or proffering superfluous information, and so the
imposition is saved.</p>

<p class="p2">As a general rule, the Continental railway carriages are
superior in comfort to our own, although latterly improvement
has been made in this direction on some of the
English lines. On most of the foreign lines, the second-class
carriages are, or were, equal to our first, and practically almost
the only difference between first and second consists in the
number of passengers which they take, the first class
taking eight in each compartment, and the second ten.
In the line between Cette and Bayonne, and possibly on
other lines, the second-class carriages are not so good, and
are more like our own, and do not possess that with
which those on other lines are fitted up&mdash;a netting overhead
similar to what is placed in our first-class carriages for
the reception of small things; hooks are substituted. Sometimes
one gets into the older class of carriage, as we did
once between Arles and Marseilles, where the compartments
are uncomfortably narrow.</p>

<p>In France, it seems quite the rule to crowd the carriages
to the utmost. I never learnt the reason, but have imagined
that a Government duty or tax is levied on every carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
used. If so, it is highly desirable that this tax should be
removed.</p>

<p>In all the French trains, and I think also in other
countries, there is in each class a division <i>pour dames
seules</i>; and as occasionally there is only one second-class
carriage in the train, and the post may, if a mail train,
occupy one compartment of it, there is in such a case only
one compartment left for the general travellers by second
class&mdash;a circumstance which is productive of inconvenience
to them. The officials peremptorily keep the <i>dames
seules</i> portion for ladies only. On one occasion I had
unwittingly got into one with three ladies of my party, and
with our whole effects; but although all the ladies in the
carriage politely expressed their willingness that I should
remain, the guard compelled me to descend and find another
compartment for myself.</p>

<p>On most lines in France, Switzerland, and Italy, there
are compartments which are marked as non-smoking; but
although so marked, little regard is paid to the distinction,
particularly on the Italian lines. The men seem
to have very little notion that it is a most selfish act
to pollute the air breathed by their fellow-passengers for
the sake of indulging in one of their own&mdash;to many
others, disagreeable&mdash;habits which might be postponed until
they get out; and so little is thought about it, that it
would require Sydney Smith’s ‘Surgical Operation’ to imbue
them with the idea that it is a discomfort to others, or
that when asked to stop smoking, it is their duty at
once as gentlemen to comply. On one occasion in Italy,
after speaking to successive passengers, some of whom
complied, and some would not, I spoke to the guard; but
he paid no attention to the complaint (the carriage being
non-smoking), and in charity let me suppose he did not
comprehend what I said. But, indeed, the cigar seems
hardly ever out of the mouth of the Italian, and one
wonders how the humbler classes can spare the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
from their small earnings to spend upon this expensive
practice.</p>

<p class="p2">Foreigners are very fond in the hot weather of putting
down all the six windows of the compartment, thus creating
draughts, from which I have several times caught a cold.
They have not the slightest notion of closing a window in
passing through a tunnel, and on some lines the tunnels are
frequent and long. But while they put down the glass,
they also draw down the blue blinds placed over each
window, under pretence of the shining of the sun, but
quite as often for no conceivable reason except that the
glass is down, or that they don’t want to be bothered looking
out. It is of no manner of consequence although the
scenery through which one is passing be the finest or the
grandest possible, down goes the blue blind without even
the politeness of asking the other passengers whether they
so desire or not. As often as I could, I secured a place at
the window, and showed that, although a native of a colder
clime, I could stand the sunshine for the sake of the view.
On one occasion, on a former tour, travelling by diligence
from Geneva to Chamounix, there were some Germans
smoking continually, as usual, on the seats before us. These
men, though approaching the grandest scenery in Europe,
insisted angrily on a leather curtain being kept down, so as
to exclude all view, simply because the raising of it admitted
a little sunshine. But this habit is not confined to Germans;
and the conclusion to which I have come is that, to
say nothing of the quality of inherent politeness in true
consideration for others, the generality of foreigners have
no high appreciation for scenery, or are desperately afraid
of their complexion, which, to say the truth, cannot rival
that of the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>I should just add, that in Switzerland, on some of the
lines, the railway carriages are constructed somewhat on the
American plan, by which entrance is made from end to end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the carriage, and the guard can thus pass through from
one carriage to another. At Interlachen, between the two
lakes, there is an upper storey to enable people the better to
see the views. Carriages similarly constructed are for the
same reason run upon the little line between Bayonne and
Biarritz.</p>

<p class="p2">The speed on Continental railways is, as compared with
that on English railways, very slow. There are what are
called express trains, but these express trains do not attain
the celerity of our ordinary trains. For example, the express
which leaves Paris at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> reaches Mentone the following
day at 3.50 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;that is, 690 miles in twenty-nine hours, or
at the rate of 24 miles per hour; and for long journeys like
this in France, first-class tickets must be taken. Express
trains are not, however, always to be had, and one is doomed
frequently to long and tiresome journeys. To go from
Nismes to Toulouse, our train took ten hours, stopping at
thirty different stations by the way between Cette and
Toulouse, with twenty minutes to dine at Narbonne, the
previous part of the journey between Nismes and Cette, a
short distance, having been express. The distance is only
298 kilometres, or about 186 miles for the whole journey,
the rate of speed between Cette and Toulouse being thus
only between 14 and 15 miles per hour. In like manner
eight hours were consumed in the journey between Pau and
Toulouse, which is about 130 miles, or rather more than
16 miles per hour. Not only is the speed slow, but at any
station at which the trains stop, there is a detention for an
apparently useless length of time. Occasionally long stoppages
occur also where the lines are single only. In one
short journey of 37 miles between St. Sebastian in Spain
and Biarritz, two hours were lost from this cause by waiting
at two stations for trains from the other end to pass. More
powerful locomotives were promised upon the line between
Paris and Marseilles, by which it was expected the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of 536 miles might be accomplished in twelve hours; but
they do not yet appear to have been placed upon it.</p>

<p>If, however, the speed be less, the security is greater.
We seldom hear of accidents on the Continental lines.</p>

<p>There are peculiarities about the French trains which
render it necessary to study the <i>Indicateur</i> very carefully, as
some trains take only first-class passengers, and others have
no first class; and although the first train going may be
taken, it does not follow that it will be the first to arrive at
the destination. A still further and annoying peculiarity is,
that the railway company by first-class express trains will
not always book to every station on the line at which they
stop. Thus a friend left Mentone for Heidelberg. On
arrival at Marseilles, he found himself compelled to book to
Paris to get on. Thence he went to Strasbourg. Nor would
it be possible to leave the line at Lyons, because the luggage
would be registered to Paris.</p>

<p class="p2">The arrangements of the railways in regard to stations
correspond in some degree with our own; but they have
their specialties, into which I need not enter. The system
of <i>salles-d’attente</i> and of registration of luggage necessitate
stations being built on a much larger scale than our own.
Sometimes tickets are collected before arriving at the <i>gare</i>,
but more frequently are inconveniently taken at the narrow
<i>sortie</i> or <i>uscita</i> from the passengers encumbered with luggage.
Outside the station a host of porters and <i>commissionaires</i> of
hotels is immediately encountered, and beyond this crowd,
often largely swelled by mere idle onlookers, and perhaps by
an occasional pickpocket, a long line of omnibuses and cabs.
It is the practice in many, perhaps most places, for every
hotel to keep an omnibus which goes to the station for every
train. Probably there is some jealousy lest cab-drivers or
general omnibus conductors might beguile or be bribed to
beguile the visitors to certain hotels; but whether it be from
this cause or from ostentation, the consequence is that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is waiting for employment a number of conveyances altogether
out of proportion to the number of passengers requiring
conveyance. I have counted at Mentone, waiting arrival
of a train, twenty omnibuses, inclusive of a general one, with
their respective drivers and conductors, and nearly as many
cabs; while the number of passengers leaving the train would
not exceed twenty in all, of whom probably not three would
require conveyance. The maintenance of these omnibuses
must be attended with heavy expense to the hotelkeepers;
and although it can by no means pay for the expense, the
charge against the visitor is heavy. The general omnibus,
with a few specially-adapted cabs, would suffice in most
places for all the traffic. It is melancholy to see the almost
hourly procession of empty ‘buses, relieved only occasionally
by one of them exhibiting in triumph a solitary occupant,
and perhaps bearing five or six large boxes on its top. In
Paris and Toulouse, and some other places, there are little
district or family omnibuses holding four or six persons,
unconnected with any hotel&mdash;a far better arrangement.</p>

<p>The charge for a seat in the omnibus is usually, in a town
or general omnibus, without luggage, either 30 or 50 centimes;
with luggage, 1 franc. The hotel omnibuses never charge
less than 1 franc per person; and with luggage it is usually
1½ francs. If a party consist of four, it has thus to pay
6 francs or 5s. for the drive to the hotel, which is expensive;
and it is much cheaper, if there be not heavy luggage, for
which the cabs are seldom adapted, to take a cab. This
cannot easily be done at leaving the hotel, as the guests are
expected to employ the hotel omnibus, which is charged as
matter of course in the bill.</p>

<p>We experienced at Rome a curious species of imposition.
Not finding a carriage which would have taken our luggage,
we entered the general omnibus, for which the fare for three
persons was, the conductor told us, 3 francs, and drove to the
house where we expected to obtain quarters. It turned out
to be full, and I left the omnibus, crossed the street on foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and inquired at two hotels, at the second of which I found
accommodation, and the omnibus brought across the luggage.
The conductor demanded 10 francs for what he called the
several courses, and I was glad, with the assistance of the
landlord of the hotel, to arrange for 6 francs; but we were
afterwards informed that this conductor was notorious for
such practices.</p>

<p class="p2">It is sometimes desired to send luggage or boxes by goods
trains <i>petite vitesse</i>. I had occasion to do so from Lyons to
Mentone. A declaration was, by aid of the landlord of our
hotel, filled up, containing, among other particulars, the
general contents of the boxes which he sent to the goods
office, and they were duly forwarded to their destination.
The time taken in the transit varies and depends on circumstances&mdash;it
may be weeks. It is therefore never safe to
send off by goods train luggage which may be immediately
wanted. The cost of carriage is so much per 50 kilogrammes;
all below the 50 is charged the same as 50. For
this weight between Lyons and Mentone, I paid 5½ francs.
Between Paris and Mentone it would have been 7 to 8 francs;
between Marseilles and Mentone, 3 francs. These figures
will give an approximate idea of the cost. On leaving
Mentone, the second season, I sent a box (under 50 kilogrammes
weight) to Glasgow, to care of Messrs. J. and P.
Cameron, railway agents, to go by <i>petite vitesse</i> to Marseilles,
and thence by sea to Glasgow, where Messrs. Cameron passed
it through the customs and despatched it to Edinburgh. The
total cost was 6s. 10d. A box I sent from Naples to the
care of a mercantile friend in Liverpool, by whom it was
passed and forwarded to Edinburgh, cost for carriage, Naples
to Edinburgh, £1, 2s. 6d. This amount embraced shipping
agents’ charges, and was sent as freight. Had I sent the
box simply as a parcel, it would have cost 5s. 6d. less, but
the shipper would not for the lesser charge undertake
responsibility beyond 40s.; and looking to the thievish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
character of the Neapolitans, I thought it safer to pay the
additional charge. The difficulty one feels about sending
off things to pass a frontier, is the examination by the
<i>douaniers</i>; but I believe that some of the <i>expediteurs</i>, to be
found in all towns, undertake for a small fee to get this
managed. I presume they procure the passing through upon
the footing of known or credited respectability of the party
sending. I sent to Glasgow and Liverpool an exact list of
the contents of the boxes, for exhibition, if need were, to the
authorities. Some of the bankers&mdash;as, for example, Messrs.
Macquay, Hooker, and Co., Florence&mdash;undertake to despatch
goods and works of art to any place in Europe.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>CONTINENTAL HOTEL AND PENSION LIFE.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">‘The</span> inn looked so much like a gentleman’s house that we
could hardly believe it was an inn,’ is the observation made
by Miss Wordsworth in her <i>Recollections of a Tour in
Scotland in 1803</i>, upon arriving at one which differed
signally from others, where they could hardly obtain even
sleeping room, and that of the roughest kind. Books of
travels do indeed afford glimpses into the state of accommodation
provided for travellers in those ‘good old times,’
but they are only glimpses. People, in recounting their
wanderings in their own country, seldom notice such matters,
unless they find them either rather better or rather worse
than the prevailing condition of things to which the force of
habit has reconciled them. In truth, the inns of Great
Britain in the beginning of this century were what would now
be reckoned of a very humble class, and were frequently
planted and to be discovered in localities which would now
be considered most undesirable, and which were doubtless
chosen from proximity either to markets or to the stations of
stage-coach departure and arrival, if they did not themselves
create them, and in positions where stabling and a stable-yard
might advantageously and fitly be placed.</p>

<p>The introduction and development of the railway system
have effected such an extraordinary increase in the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of travelling as to have, in respect of such public accommodation,
produced, or rather necessitated, a revolutionary
change. The old little inn, with its rubicund jovial hail-fellow-well-met
landlord and its horsey adjuncts, has in the
larger towns all but disappeared, or, if left for the benefit of
the antiquary as a relic and specimen of a past age, receives
its chief patronage on market days from the farmers, who
find it convenient to stall their animals in its stables, and
enjoy a homely dinner at its moderate table. Instead of it,
whole streets of hotels, in the best situations, and possessed
of all the comforts with which modern civilisation can furnish
them, are built and occupied, and in busy times are sometimes
full to overflowing. The very nomenclature indicates
a superior tone. The house ceases to be an ‘inn,’ and becomes
a ‘hotel.’ The Saracen Heads, the White Harts, and
the Georges give way to national or big swelling names. We
are become imperial in the very appellations we bestow even
on houses in which we tarry only for a night.</p>

<p class="p2">A similar or even greater reform has been attained in the
Continental towns. The discomforts of the old houses there
were no doubt much greater than they were with ourselves;
and, indeed, even now, if we abandon the tourists’ highway, or
run away from the larger towns, a primitive and perhaps
far from agreeable state of matters is discovered, the fact
being that much of the improvement which has taken place
is due to studying the requirements of <i>les Anglais</i>. But in
the leading improvements the foreigners have led the van,
and we may be said to follow at a respectful distance.</p>

<p class="p2">The tendency abroad is, as it is at home, towards building
large establishments in which the rooms are reckoned by the
hundred, one of the hotels in Paris, the Grand (most new hotels
abroad now have ‘Grand’ prefixed to some other and more
distinctive designation, but this is ‘The Grand’ <i>par excellence</i>),
advertising as many as 800 rooms; another (the Louvre),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
700,&mdash;figures which are beyond anything, I suppose, in
England, unless it be (though perhaps not even there) in the
Midland Railway Hotel, St. Pancras. There is at all times a
greater likelihood of finding accommodation, and such accommodation
as may be desired, in houses of such formidable
dimensions; but the visitor’s importance suffers a shock: he
becomes nothing but a number, and as such is termed by
the <i>employés</i> of the hotel, and shouted up and down the
speaking tubes.</p>

<p class="p2">But a more important result follows from the immense
augmentation in travelling, because the intercourse thus
brought about between the inhabitants of countries originally
differing very widely in their manners and customs has a
direct tendency to assimilate not merely their manners and
customs, but their modes of living. Hence the peculiarities
of each gradually, if good, are adopted&mdash;if bad, are lost. We
borrow from the foreigners, they borrow from us. Odd ways
and angular corners get rubbed off, and Cæsar and Pompey
settle down in time ‘very much ‘like,’ specially Pompey.
Yet, when one leaves the home country, he happily discerns
there are still remaining considerable differences between
life abroad and life in Britain. Hotels on the Continent are
conducted on somewhat different principles from those
which at least formerly were customary in Great Britain; and
until the dead level of uniformity be reached, it may not be
uninteresting to recall some of the differences, and to mention
circumstances attendant upon hotel life abroad, which, to those
not very familiar with the subject, may be noteworthy.</p>

<p class="p2">In general construction, the more recently erected hotels
at home and abroad do not materially differ. Tardily we
are beginning to adopt the foreign system of numerous and
spacious public rooms, and especially public drawing-rooms,
to which ladies can freely resort. But in one important
element of comfort to the weak or weary visitor, the foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are behind ourselves, inasmuch as lifts (<i>ascenseurs</i>) do not
seem to be very common; and really in these many-floored
hotels they are needed. The only places where we have seen
them have been in the hotels of Paris and Marseilles, and
they were not always in working order. In addition to the
long stairs to be ascended, there are often in these large
hotels lengthy corridors to traverse, so that it is a journey
from the outer door to the bedroom, in some cases requiring
a study of the <i>locale</i>, so as to avoid being lost in the
labyrinth.</p>

<p class="p2">Next to comfort, the matter of charges is one of primary
consideration to most travellers, and can scarcely be overlooked
in treating of hotel life. Generally it may be observed,
that notwithstanding there has been abroad, as there has been
at home, a very considerable rise in charges from former
scales, the cost of living at hotels abroad is, as it used to
be, still under, or on an average considerably under, the cost
for similar comforts and accommodation at home.</p>

<p>The cost of rooms is regulated primarily by the floor or
<i>étage</i> on which they are situated; and if the visitor desire
to be economical, he ought to ask for rooms upon the
higher floors, say the third, or even, where it exists, the
fourth <i>étage</i>. First-floor rooms are always charged high,
sometimes exorbitantly so. At Milan we were shown into
bedrooms on the first floor, which, had we taken, would have
cost us about 20 to 25 francs per night per room. In Nice
as much as 75 francs, or £3 per day, have been asked for two
rooms on the first floor of a leading hotel, being equal to a
rent per annum of £1095. A friend who spent the winter
at Cannes told me he paid 75 francs per day for the rooms
he had in one of the principal hotels, but probably he had
three or four rooms. In Mentone the highest I have known
paid by friends has been, for a large saloon and a bedroom,
both princely rooms, 50 francs, or about £2 per day, equal
to a rent per annum, were they let all the year round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of £730. These, however, are season places, and such rooms
would remain vacant a considerable portion of the year, and
even, a consequence of the high charge, for great part of the
season, as the hotelkeepers will not lower their price even
for a short period.</p>

<p>In Italy it is always desirable, where there is an ability
to mount long stairs, to take rooms as high up as possible,
so as to get as far away as may be from the odours of
the street; but the same rule as regards the charges for
rooms prevails. Perhaps in nothing do foreign hotel charges
differ more than in the charges for rooms. They differ
according to the place&mdash;that is, whether it be a large or a
small town; according to the hotel, whether it be first class
or inferior; and according to the rooms themselves, their
position, size, and furnishing, and also according as they are
single or double bedded. Abroad, nearly every bedroom large
enough is so constructed as to fit it for use also as a sitting-room
or <i>salon</i>, in which friends may be received. Sometimes
the beds are placed in a recess or back part of the room, which
may be shut off at will by drawing a curtain. The rooms
abound with mirrors; but unless in houses frequented by the
English, there are for the most part no carpets on the floors,
saving a rug at the bedside, thus and otherwise involving
an odd mixture of splendour and discomfort. However,
carpets are beginning to be more frequently introduced. To
those accustomed to the warmth of carpets, getting out of bed
in the morning is, when they are wanting, a chilly operation,
more especially when the floors are constructed, as they
sometimes are, I presume for protection against vermin, of
composition.</p>

<p>On an average, I would say that a bedroom on a third floor,
with one bed for a single person, costs from 3 to 5 francs
per night; a double-bedded room, from 5 to 8 francs. On
the second floor the price is advanced a little; but the first
floor is always high, varying according to circumstances.
In some fashionable places, such as Nice and Biarritz, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the season the charge for rooms is, in first-class hotels,
as what I have already said shows, extravagantly high. The
season at Nice is not, like many places, for two or three
months only, but lasts the whole winter&mdash;half of the year. It
ought not therefore, one would think, to be so expensive.</p>

<p>But lights have to be paid for separately, and are usually
charged at hotels at the rate of 1 franc per <i>bougie</i> or candle,
although I have seen only 75 centimes charged, and in some
out-of-the-way places as little as half a franc, or even, as at
Chateau d’&OElig;x, 30 centimes, upon which no doubt there was a
profit. I was told of the case of a visitor at an expensive hotel
in Nice who was, a good many years ago, charged 16 francs
for <i>bougies</i> for a single night. But this mode of plundering is
now so far abandoned, and one has only to be careful that
more candles than he desires be not lighted. The charge for
<i>bougies</i>, if remaining only single nights at hotels, becomes
heavy; but if several nights be spent in the house, the candles
remain till burned down. It is said that foreigners carry off
their unburnt <i>bougies</i> with them, and use them at next stoppage,
as they carry off also, it is alleged, the sugar which they
have not used, but for which they consider they have paid.
These, however, are petty habits, to which English people
have not yet got accustomed.</p>

<p>The charge for service is almost invariably 1 franc per
night per person. As lights are not charged in England, the
united charge for <i>bougies</i> and service comes, for short periods,
to be very much the same as the charge in England for
service alone.</p>

<p>Universally, abroad, the beds are constructed only to hold
one person. This may be, though it is not always, because
of the summer’s heat. In some rare cases the beds are found
to be broad enough for two; but it does not necessarily follow
that the charge is in this case as for one occupant. I have
seen charge made for a broad bed as much as if the room
had contained two beds. In parts where mosquitoes exist,
the beds are draped with mosquito curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Each room has its key and corresponding number, and the
visitor is expected, upon leaving his chamber, to lock his
door, and hang the key upon the key-board which is under
charge of the <i>concierge</i> at the entrance to the hotel. In very
large hotels, there is a key-board for each floor, in charge of
an attendant. So contrary is this system of locking doors to
the habits of the English, that it is often neglected by them;
so much so, that in hotels exclusively frequented by natives
of our isle, such a thing as locking doors and bringing down
keys would be looked upon as extraordinary. At one of
these hotels, I asked a servant, upon leaving my room after
arrival, where the key should be put, as I had seen no key-board.
‘Oh, just leave it in the door,’ was her reply.
Foreigners always lock their doors, whatever may be the
establishment in which they are; and in many places, especially
in the large hotels of Paris, where nobody knows who
may be his next neighbour, it is highly proper and safe to
do so. In this connection I may just observe that somehow
or other there are in most places hotels which are only
patronized by the English, and a foreigner is a <i>rara avis</i>.
Correspondingly, there are other hotels which they never
visit. There must be some species of intuitive freemasonry
which underlies and conduces to this result.</p>

<p class="p2">All hotels have a public <i>salle à manger</i>, to which both
ladies and gentlemen are expected to go, and nearly all have
drawing-rooms or reading-rooms, or both (<i>salons</i> and <i>salons-de-lecture</i>).
A lady travelling by herself can freely go to all
these rooms, and one constantly meets such <i>dames seules</i>. No
necessity is imposed upon them to engage a <i>salon</i> or sitting-room.
But if desirous of taking them out of the public
rooms, the meals will be sent to the bedrooms, for which
luxury and extra trouble, however, there is a charge made,
sometimes as high, at least for dinner, as 2 francs or 3 francs
per person per meal, though usually only ½ franc.</p>

<p>In addition to placing in the reading-rooms newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
which generally comprise one or more of the leading London
journals (received in many places within twenty-four
hours of their publication), there usually and most properly
is in hotels, where visitors come for lengthened periods, a
small collection of books sufficient to beguile an hour or a
wet day.</p>

<p class="p2">The three chief meals of the day are breakfast, lunch, and
dinner.</p>

<p>In what I shall call the English hotels, almost everybody
maintains the good old English custom of coming down to the
<i>salle-à-manger</i> to breakfast; but foreigners, consistently with
their home practice, take their meagre breakfast or cup of
coffee, scarcely to be designated breakfast, in their bedroom.
English people cannot get reconciled to the idea of taking
meals in a room in which they sleep. It is an uncomfortable
and unsocial custom, essentially bad&mdash;keeps the
bedrooms long from being attended to, and imposes much
additional labour on the servants, who are kept flying up
and down stairs at all hours of the morning with breakfast
equipage.</p>

<p>The usual charge at all hotels, at least as against
Englishmen, for breakfast proper (tea, coffee, or chocolate,
with bread and butter) is 1½ francs. Occasionally, though
very rarely, I have found it only charged 1 franc, and once,
viz. at Toulouse, 2 francs. Eggs are universally charged
25 centimes (2½d.) each; meats and fish, according to <i>carte</i>,
and generally expensive.</p>

<p class="p2">But foreigners make a more substantial meal a little later
on, which they call <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>, corresponding
somewhat to our lunch. This is intended to be the real
breakfast, and, according to true Continental fashion, it proceeds
at many places at so early an hour as half-past ten, at
others at eleven or twelve o’clock. In such cases it is found
to be a most substantial repast, consisting of several courses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
generally three&mdash;meat courses, pudding or tart course and
cheese, and fruit courses; and it is in reality an early dinner,
the whole company in the hotel assembling to enjoy it, unless
individually they otherwise arrange. In the English hotels
they have ‘lunch’ usually at one o’clock; but this is of a much
less substantial nature, the visitor having been credited with
making <i>more Anglici</i> a good breakfast in the morning. The
charge for <i>déjeuner</i> or lunch differs according to the hotel,
but is usually about 3 francs.</p>

<p class="p2">The <i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner is a regular Continental institution,
which it would be well were it made the rule at home.
Meaning literally dinner at the table of the host, I presume
that at one time, and before the establishment of great hotels,
the host regularly presided. This, however, is now rarely
seen, although I have sat down to dine at a table where he
took his place. Rising as each course arrived, and putting
on an apron, he would with dexterous rapidity carve what
was brought in, then, putting off his apron, would sit down
again and take part with the guests.</p>

<p>Each hotel has its fixed hour for this dinner, varying in
time from six to seven o’clock. I have also seen a special
<i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner at eight o’clock, to suit those arriving by
late trains. In places frequented by Germans, such as
Interlachen, they have two dinner hours&mdash;one at two o’clock,
for the Germans chiefly; and the other in the evening, to
suit those who prefer dining at a later hour. The hotel
people are frequently disturbed and put about by visitors,
usually English people, inexcusably coming tardily to table.
The charge for <i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner varies a good deal at
different places, 4 to 5 francs being about the average rate,
though occasionally it is less. In Paris some of the large
hotels charge 6 francs&mdash;wine, however, included, as is customary
in Paris.</p>

<p>The dinner, which is served <i>à la Russe</i>, consists of many
courses, and is not, generally speaking, of the substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
character of an English home dinner. The routine is everywhere
the same, and consists of the following courses, which
the waiters present at the division assigned to each quietly
at sound of finger bell:&mdash;(1) Potage or soup; (2) Fish, when
it can be had, otherwise a substitute; (3) Entrées; (4) Vegetables
by themselves, such as cauliflower, French beans or
peas; (5) Poultry or game, or otherwise roast beef or roast
mutton, accompanied invariably by salad or lettuce, and
water-cresses; (6) Pudding or tart; (7) Fruits; (8) Sweet
biscuits. In some of the grander places there is a course
of ice-cream, and in other hotels ice-creams take the place
of pudding on Sundays, or sometimes on both Sundays
and Thursdays.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Such is the invariable routine, the only
variety being in the specific description of the articles in
each course. The great want in these dinners is of a good
supply of vegetables; bread, not so wholesome, being supplied
at discretion. It would be better if some of the viands were
dispensed with, and more vegetables given. Such a thing
as a good dry potato, what they call <i>au naturel</i>, is hardly
known. Potatoes are served up greased in every conceivable
way, or, if presented dry or in their skins, they are accompanied
by a separate plate of butter. One course often
excites remark by English visitors. It is where the game
course consists of small birds, especially thrushes. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
afford a miserable bite apiece, and, for a party of 40 or 50,
as many birds fall to be sacrificed, the rule of the table being
that every guest is, or has the opportunity of being, served
alike. At Cannes, at one of the hotels (season 1876-77),
a round robin was subscribed by the English of the
party, protesting against such use of thrushes&mdash;I do not
know with what effect. They were to be sometimes seen
hanging in bunches at the poulterers’ doors. It seems a
cruel use of such song-birds, which are fed upon grapes to
fatten them for the table; yet all the grapes they could swallow,
even though in quantity enough to satisfy the grape cure,
would never make them more than a miserable picking.</p>

<p class="p2">The quantities of eggs, fowl, and game which are needed to
supply so many tables must be enormous; and as one sees
very few live poultry anywhere, it has occasioned me surprise
to think how they can be procured. The only feasible
explanation is that the country is ransacked far and near
for food to supply the luxurious tables of the hotels, and the
wants of town populations. In a book published in 1857
by Dr. Frederick Johnson,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> it is stated with regard to Paris
alone&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘That the great Metropolitan maw occupies 712 bakers, and daily consumes
479,015 loaves and rolls (we abandon verbal computation in despair),
and annually 6,849,449 poultry, 1,329,964 larks, 26,000 kids, 9,937,430
kilos of fish (the kilo being 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> lbs. English), 5,006,770 kilos of confectionery,
150,223,006 kilos of pears; that yearly each Parisian swallows 69 oysters,
165 eggs, 137 quarts of wine, and 14 quarts of beer among his other luxuries;
and that among them, in their little enjoyments, they gossip over 3,000,000
kilos of coffee, 350,000 kilos of chicory, 2,000,000 lbs. of chocolate, and
40,000 kilos of tea, assisted by 109,221,086 quarts of milk. Teetotallers
may be alarmed for the public sobriety when they learn that, besides the
wines and brandies, our Parisian pleasure-seekers dispose of 1,267,230 quarts
of liqueurs, to say nothing of 350,000 kilos of brandied bonbons, and that they
cool the consequences with 500,000 quarts of ice.’</p>

<p class="p1">If such be the consumption of Paris, and this is more than
twenty years ago, what must that be of all France, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
nothing of other Continental countries? Our box of figure-counters
would soon be exhausted in vain attempts at the
calculation. We should have to borrow largely from the
astronomers.</p>

<p class="p2">The guests are, of course, expected to help themselves to
only a small portion of each course. We once (in 1862) saw
an Englishman in Paris, unacquainted with the customs
either of France or of good society, appropriate to himself at
one round nearly all that was in the dish, and we never could
pass that untutored savage without thinking of the plateful
of coarse beef which he had doomed himself to eat. But
most Germans, Dutch and Spanish people feed very largely,
and make no scruple as a practice to take double supplies, and
the largest and best pieces of everything which comes round,
leaving those who come after them wofully scant.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
waiters are well acquainted with this habit, and pander to it,
possibly in hope of fees. At Biarritz, where we experienced
a singular practice of the waiter doling out portions to the
visitors (on the footing, perhaps, that some of them could not
be trusted to leave even a wreck behind), they, as matter of
course, placed upon the plates of the Spaniards of the company
large quantities of each course, while when they came
to ourselves we received often such small portions that we
would occasionally complain and get more.</p>

<p class="p2">At many places in France and elsewhere, wine is included
in the charge for dinner. In this case it is the <i>vin ordinaire</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the place, and is generally good if fresh; but as the practice
is to put down a carafe to each two persons, much of
it is often left. I have sometimes found the wine sour,
evidently arising from having been kept from day to day,
adding only what was necessary to replenish the carafes.
The <i>vin ordinaire</i> costs the hotelkeeper very little, although
he would charge from 1 franc to 2 francs per bottle for it if
ordered. Everybody is expected to take wine, even children;
and where wine is not included and set down, the
waiter goes round, not asking whether you wish wine, but,
‘What wine will you take?’ and you have to select from
the <i>carte</i>. I have been much surprised at the great differences
in the price of wine at different places. The same
kind of wine is charged at one place, it may be three, even
four times as much as at another; and in general the price
rises, and rises far out of reason, according to the distance
from which the wine is supposed to come. Many lay it
down as a rule to take the wine of the district in which they
for the time being are; and it can, at all events, be had good
of its kind and cheap, costing, some kinds, from 1 franc to
2 francs per bottle. This, which in the locality is called
<i>vin ordinaire</i>, elsewhere becomes a high-priced wine. A
fair quality of wine can in general be had at about 3 francs
or 2s. 6d. per bottle, although it is observable that the bottles
are so made as evidently to be incapable of containing a
quart. If they be not small in size, they are sure deceptively
to have a large hollow lump of glass in the bottom. Wine,
with the exception of the better descriptions, is never drunk
pure, but is poured into a tumbler and mixed with water,
about half of each.</p>

<p class="p2">When dinner, lasting about an hour, is over, everybody is
expected to rise and leave the room. At one hotel the
waiters compelled retreat by opening all the windows. They
have to clear the table and wash up, and are naturally
anxious to have the room to themselves. Besides, in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
places, the servants’ supper takes place at ring of bell
immediately after dinner, and no doubt the waiters are
anxious to join. Their dinner bell in like manner rings
after lunch. Visitors are seldom aware of these internal
arrangements, or alive to them if they be.</p>

<p>If one does not dine at <i>table d’hôte</i>, to dine <i>à la carte</i>,
by selecting out of a list, is costly, and should if possible
be avoided. When arriving too late for <i>table d’hôte</i>, we have
found in some places that we could order a dinner for which
the same regular charge was made as at <i>table d’hôte</i>, although
perhaps this might not be done for a single visitor. At
other places the better course, particularly in Italy, is to
order a dinner at a given figure, leaving the hotel to supply
what they choose. One is certain by doing so to be better
off.</p>

<p class="p2">At table, various Continental practices may be noticed, and
among others a very singular custom which the German
gentlemen have of tucking their napkins under their chins,
and spreading them over the breast like a row of babies
with their bibs on. I never could look at a German so arrayed
without thinking of the minister who,</p>

<p class="ppi6 p1">‘Being wi’ the palsy tribbled,<br />
In liftin’ spoonfu’s aften dribbled;<br />
Sae, to prevent the draps o’ broth,<br />
Prinn’d to his breast the tablecloth.’</p>

<p class="p1">Some explanation of this ludicrous practice is perhaps
to be found in the painful habit which the generality
of Germans have&mdash;occasionally ladies as well as men&mdash;of
eating with their knives. English people cannot witness
this fearful and wonderful operation without a nervous
dread of the result. But there is this to be said for the
Germans, that although some of their customs be peculiar,
and not to be copied, they are great linguists, and enter agreeably
in English into conversation; and I only mention such
little foibles, that they may ‘see themselves as others see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
them.’ In many places&mdash;Switzerland particularly&mdash;there is
put down upon the table here and there a case of what
turns out to be toothpicks. One would think that those
who choose to injure their teeth by means of such instruments
and perform an odious cleansing, would prefer to keep their
private pick, as much as their private tooth-brush, and use
it in their private room.</p>

<p>We found the Dutch people ceremoniously polite. They
never sat down and never rose from the table, never entered
a room and never left it, without bowing to all round.
It always kept us in a fidget lest they should not receive
like courtesy; but it is a very pleasant trait of character
in a people whom we found to be not merely externally
polite, but kind and cordial at heart.</p>

<p class="p2">At the hotels, unless they be what I have called English
hotels, one usually meets with people of all countries. In
one hotel in France, I was informed we had representatives
of eight different nations, counting English, Scotch, and
Irish as one. It has struck me, however, that although the
French language is so generally spoken, the French themselves,
while found travelling in every part of their own
land, are very seldom seen in other countries. I was on
one occasion sitting next a bright Parisian young lady,
and rather wickedly, I fear, was exalting Edinburgh so
as to suggest its taking the palm from Paris. She was
astonished, and having asked her when she was coming to see
Edinburgh, she replied very decidedly, though in the very
bewitching way in which the French girls speak, ‘Jamais,
ne-verre,’ which honestly meant there was no probability
she would, although the emphasis no doubt was intended as
a delicate rebuke to the heretical presumption of my thought.
<i>La belle France</i> is <i>tout le monde</i> to Frenchmen; nor do they
get much encouragement to cross the English Channel, for
I have noticed that they are, as a rule, most unhappy
sailors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>One meets with all peoples and tongues and sorts at the
dinner table. Now, much of comfort at that interesting
time depends upon who sit next you. Dining at a long
table with a large company is never so genial as dining
round a smaller table in a party of six or eight. Intercourse
is almost limited to those on the right and left, unless you
and those opposite have strong voices and be both remarkably
socially inclined. This, bad enough at home, is
intensified abroad, not merely among strangers, but strangers
who are foreigners, with whose language you may not be
particularly acquainted. Everything, then, turns on the
question, ‘Who is my neighbour?’ and in this respect one is
all but entirely at the mercy of the waiters, who have not the
grimmest idea of social assortment; and it may be that you
are for weeks together placed next to those with whom you
have no <i>rapport</i> or fellow-feeling or congeniality of tastes&mdash;nay,
with whom you may be unable to exchange a word.
When it is otherwise, and people are social, intelligent, well
read, and without necessarily being clever are cheerful, the
dinner hour becomes a pleasant episode of the day.</p>

<p>But it is often otherwise. It is bad enough to get placed
beside a foreigner whose language, perhaps, you can read,
but whose oral pronunciation is perfectly unintelligible; or
beside a very stout and important lady whose ideas, if she
have any, run on subjects with which you have no possible
sympathy&mdash;who is too ponderous, or whose composite capital,
perhaps stuck tenderly on with pins, is&mdash;it may, from the
steadiness of her carriage, be supposed&mdash;considered by her
too fragile to bear the shaking and jolting of a joke&mdash;or
really, to confess the truth, one whom, it may possibly be,
you cannot be bothered to entertain; or beside a young
lady who speaks so low and so timidly, that in the din of
dinner it is literally impossible to hear what she says. Nor
is it less distressing to be placed beside a very deaf person
who not only does not catch what you say, but, as usual
with deaf people, speaks indistinctly. Few have not had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
such an experience as this. You are seated beside what
appears to you to be a very amiable, comfortable, benign old
lady. The beverage before you is in a condition which it
would not be safe to swallow for a little. You are both
resting on your oars, or rather on your spoons. The moment
is favourable for an opening speech. The subject you select
is one of personal and common interest. The observation
you hazard is such as would in no event occasion a division
bell to ring. Quietly you say, ‘The soup is hot.’ She
inclines her face as if she had just heard you were talking
in her direction. ‘The soup is hot.’ An inquiring glance
is directed to you. Again you repeat rather louder, ‘The
soup is hot.’ ‘Sir,’ she replies. In an alto and rather
excited pitch you proclaim, ‘The soup is hot.’ By this
time everybody has been turning a listening ear. ‘Beg
your pardon, sir; but I am rather deaf.’ ‘Madam’ (in an
altissimo and crescendo style), ‘The soup <i>is</i> <span class="smcap">HOT</span>.’ ‘Yes,’
she blandly replies, ‘the room is very hot.’ You are for
ever and for ever shut up, and retire from the struggle hot
enough yourself.</p>

<p>But sometimes the wet blanket comes in another form.
I was at one place agreeably set on several occasions beside
a lively young German lady, who spoke English fluently.
At our first interview I asked, ‘What was their national
dish? was it <i>Sauer-kraut</i>?’ ‘No, it was larks.’ ‘Oh, you
barbarians,’ I replied; ‘do you eat canaries and parrots?’
at which the fair damsel was much shocked. ‘What’s that?’
obviously whispers the heavy German next her on her other
side, and this and every other like passage of nonsense had
to be translated word for word into this intensely philomathic
alien, but withal kindly guide, philosopher, and friend of
my young neighbour.</p>

<p>I was for a considerable time at another place seated next
a most intelligent member of the French bar, whose bad
health unfortunately added to a natural taciturnity. He
could speak English, and liked to do so. We formed ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
into a mutual instruction society&mdash;I to correct his
good English, and he to correct my bad French. But as he
preferred English conversation, and I was too lazy to bore
him with my French, the educational advantages on my side
were reduced to the <i>minimum visible</i>. However, we enjoyed
to some extent rational conversation on subjects of interest,
imparting information to each other, and discussing where
we differed. Here was ‘the feast of reason.’ But, though
my friend could enjoy all that creates a laugh, ‘the flow of
soul’ would not have produced a deluge, or even turned a
mill-wheel of moderate dimensions. There is nothing so
difficult as to get merry with those who speak another
language, into which everything has mentally and slowly to
be translated, and the flashes of merriment often will neither
brook translation nor abide deliberative meditation. The
ball must be kept up. Any efforts in that direction were
therefore of a ponderous kind. Sometimes I would, with
all due and becoming gravity, put a case to him in French
law. ‘If,’ for example, I would say to him; ‘if a Frenchman
were to die, leaving an estate as large as this room (a
tolerably big one), and twelve children?’ ‘Oh, but,’ he
would interpose, smiling, ‘we have no estates so small,’
and perhaps he might have added, ‘No families so large.’</p>

<p>From him I was shifted for a time to the agreeable society
of a blooming Swedish lady, who could speak no language
but her own, and who was uncommonly ready to imagine
others were laughing at her, and accordingly to take offence.
In this fix, to make the best of it, I returned to school to
remedy the neglects of early life, and being a docile and
apparently a reverent pupil, I advanced with such rapid
strides to proficiency in the Swedish tongue, that in not
many days I learnt that in that hitherto supposed outlandish
language <i>chrystal</i> is ‘chrystal’ and <i>knife</i> is ‘knife;’
and had my studies been prolonged, I doubt not that I
should in time have come to know that the honest Swedish
people do call a spade a spade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>This interesting pursuit of knowledge under difficulties
was, however, brought to an abrupt close by my being torn
away and transferred to the company of an Irish young lady,
from whom I speedily elicited that she came from the neighbourhood
of Kilkenny. This <i>was</i> irresistible. ‘Have you
seen the tails of the two cats?’ ‘Oh, yes’ (with a merry
twinkle); ‘they are in the Kilkenny Museum.’ This museum
may, like Aladdin’s palace, have been built up in a night;
but ere twenty-four hours had elapsed, it was stocked
from floor to ceiling with such marvellous rarities as by no
possibility had been ever either dreamt of in philosophy, or,
what is more, conceived in the fertile brain of the great
Barnum.</p>

<p>In season places, such shiftings about are few and far between;
but in touring localities, during the travelling season,
when you are more or less frequently changing your own
quarters, and all around are changing almost daily too, one
is shuffled about like a card, and more vicissitudes of
association are experienced than befell the noted Gil Blas
of Santillane in the course of his eventful life.</p>

<p class="p2">The rule of the hotels seems to be that the latest comers
take the bottom of the table, and move up according as those
before them leave. At the same time this rule was frequently
infringed, and in some places we had always to ask where
to sit. Of course all meet on a footing of equality, and it
is customary for those of title&mdash;especially for foreign titled
persons, unless of the highest rank&mdash;to dine with the other
visitors. On one occasion, at a small party of ten or twelve,
an old gentleman appeared, to whom the ladies in the <i>salon</i>
had, on his entrance, bowed profoundly. We afterwards
learned from one of them he was a distinguished foreign
prince. An English marchioness or an English duke will
occasionally appear at table, but I fancy English noblemen
rarely condescend to do so. We were, however,
often finding that at the table with us were foreign persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of rank of all grades, and the foreigners of title with whom
we became at all acquainted were always very friendly and
unassuming. But generally in travelling we could not
tell who were our neighbours. It was for the most part
from the lists of visitors that the names of those in the
hotel could be discovered, and occasionally these have been
of royal rank. In this case they were necessarily notable, and
although they did not come to the public table, yet they
were seen in the gardens; and sometimes they travelled with
large retinues, and could not escape observation. At Interlachen,
General Grant and his wife came to the Jungfrau
Hotel, at which we were. He was on the night of his
arrival serenaded by a brass band, which played till near
midnight, the musicians no doubt regarding the sweet and
melodious sounds of trombones and ophicleides atoned for
any disturbance of the slumber of the visitors, or even of the
probably wearied General himself.</p>

<p class="p2">All the Continental hotels are, with few exceptions, prepared
to take visitors upon pension&mdash;that is, on board. But
there are establishments which, <i>par excellence</i>, are termed
pensions. The line of demarcation is very slender, and
some hotels are truly pensions, while some pensions are truly
hotels. The pension strict, however, is a less grand house
than the hotel. It is for the most part a large private house,
without, though not always without, the parade of <i>concierge</i>
and other distinctive marks of an hotel. As a rule, to
which there are exceptions, it is more homely, there is less
style in the method of conducting, less appearance about
the rooms, and smaller attention paid to service and sanitary
arrangements. On the other hand, the company is smaller,
and as the people come to remain for periods of time, they
fraternize better, and there is a good deal more of the home
feeling in a pension than ever finds its way into any hotel.
The better class of pensions profess to require an introduction,
but it does not necessarily follow that the company is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
more select; on the contrary, as they are usually rather less
expensive than hotels, the company is not unfrequently of a
mixed description, and consequently the name pension is,
to some extent, in disfavour with those English people who
can afford to pay hotel charges, and prefer more style.</p>

<p>At hotels, the rule, sometimes relaxed for a party, is that
people are not taken on pension under a week. A similar
rule prevails in pensions proper, and indeed during pension
season it is usually necessary to secure quarters in pensions
proper, and even in hotels, by writing for rooms some considerable
time previously.</p>

<p class="p2">The charge for pension varies very greatly, according to
the place, to the situation of the rooms, and to the season.</p>

<p>In former days the pension charge was extremely moderate.
One old gentleman told me that in his younger days
the charge in Switzerland, at least, was 3 francs per day for
everything; but this was a charge as against foreigners only,
and he, then a young Englishman, succeeded in getting off
upon this low rate by being taken for a German, he being
with a party of Germans. Even till more recent years, one
would hear of 5 francs per day being a normal charge.
These good old times have not wholly disappeared, for to
this day, in some outlying places in Switzerland, pension at
a very low rate can be procured. We spent eight days at
the Hotel Berthod, Chateau d’&OElig;x, which lies up among the
mountains, a long day’s journey from Interlachen, <i>en route</i>
for Aigle; and the charge was only 5 francs per day, with
20 centimes for service, besides <i>bougies</i>, which were charged
only 30 centimes each. This was upon the second floor,
which we preferred, as less noisy, to that below at 6 francs.
The charge on the third floor was, I believe, even a shade
less. The hotel was a wooden house of large size, and could
accommodate at least eighty guests, and in the season was
generally full, while the company was so far select, being
out of the beaten track of tourists. The accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was necessarily somewhat rough, but every attention was
paid, as far as practicable, to the comfort of the visitors.
Considering that its season lasts for scarcely three months
in the year, one would be surprised to think it possible it
could pay; but it seems that the landlord’s brother had
formerly kept the establishment, and had retired with a
competence. Everything, however, with one exception, was
cheap at Chateau d’&OElig;x, which boasts of several establishments
of the same kind, one of them (though two miles off),
‘Rosinière,’ the largest chalet in Switzerland, and picturesquely
situated in a secluded spot, dating back to 1754.</p>

<p>Pension includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedroom, and
service, sometimes also lights. Occasionally service is made
a separate charge, and is stated at from ½ franc to 1 franc
per day, according to place.</p>

<p>In many good hotels in Switzerland and elsewhere, pension
can be had at 8 francs per day. At Lugano the charge, I
noticed, during summer (1st April to 31st October), is 8
to 11 francs; during winter, 6 francs to 7 francs 50 centimes.
Both at Interlachen and Montreux, we paid at the rate of
8 francs, and had excellent quarters in first-class hotels.
With other rooms supposed to be better, the charge would
have been 10 francs per day. But in the height of the
Interlachen season, the hotels will not readily begin to take
people <i>en pension</i>. At Chamounix we were told, on a former
tour in the month of August, that the hotels there would
not take <i>en pension</i> after 15th July. By that time English
tourists begin to arrive in great shoals, and often find much
difficulty in getting quarters. When this takes place, the
applications are either refused, or the visitors are accommodated
in dependencies, which are either houses or chalets
attached to the hotel, or in some cases simply houses in the
villages in which the natives can spare a room, and therefore
not always desirable. Pension in Italy and France is
charged at a little higher rate than in Switzerland. We
found that, upon an average, 10 or 12 francs a day was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
charge in these countries; but according to the accommodation,
it would either rise above or fall below this rate,
varying from 8 to 15 or 16 francs per day. As the charge of
8 francs, which seldom secures any but a north room, covers
everything pension includes, there must be a profit out of it,
and all above that amount ought to be clear extra gain. Eight
francs per day amounts to £116 per annum, 15 francs per
day to £219&mdash;a good rate of board.</p>

<p>In season places great contrast often exists between the
charges for pension during the season and after it is over.
Thus at Biarritz, during the winter months, pension might
have been had at 7 francs per diem, but during the two
months of summer season (August and September, on to 15th
October) the charges at the principal hotels are high. For
rooms alone the charge may be from 20 to 25 francs on the
second floor, and from 12 to 14 francs per day on the third
floor, the first floor being much more costly. However, we
found at the Hotel de Paris, on 18th September, towards the
close of the season, which may have made a difference, fairly
comfortable rooms on the first floor, in a good situation, at a
moderate rate. Sometimes with first-floor rooms the usual
charges for living are made separately or in addition to the
charge for rooms.</p>

<p class="p2">Fire in the private rooms is always an extra. Nowhere is
coal burnt, at least that we have seen, unless in the northern
parts of France. The visitor, when he wishes fire, is supplied
with a basket of wood, the size and the quality of which vary
very much, as do the prices. It consists of logs sawn into
pieces about 12 to 18 inches long, and split up, and the kind
of wood necessarily varies with the locality. In the olive-growing
countries it is olive wood, which burns slowly. At
Pau it is the short oak grown in the woods in the vicinity.
In other places it is pine wood, which burns rapidly. At
Lyons we paid 2 francs for a small pannier of soft wood,
which lasted two nights. At Mentone a large pannier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
olive wood, probably mixed with pine, cost 2 francs 20
centimes, and lasted much longer. If we had no fire during
the day, and we found day fires very rarely necessary in
Mentone, a pannier would last us nearly a week for one fire
per evening, lit after dinner. At Spezzia, where the wood
burnt very fast, the pannier was charged 3·50 francs. At
Pisa the charge was 3 francs; and at Rome, had we found it
needful, we should have been charged at the hotel, for each
room, 5 francs for a pannier which would not have lasted
more than two nights. Indeed, at Rome the expense of
wood is so serious an extra charge, that I have heard of a
gentleman with a large and perhaps extravagant family
feeling obliged to curtail his visit on that account.</p>

<p>The wood is laid across two iron dogs, and emits, especially
in the case of olive wood, good heat. The ashes of former fires
are always left lying between the dogs, and greatly help to
keep the fire in. The ashes smoulder away for a long time,
and bellows, always hung by the fireside, will bring them to
a glow long after they are apparently dead.</p>

<p>The dogs are hardly suitable for coals, but might not a
good trade in coals with the Continent be brought about?
I suppose the abundance of wood renders it unnecessary.
But a great deal may result from the force of habit, or, not
improbably, there may be a prohibitory duty preventing the
people from using coal.</p>

<p class="p2">One very annoying item of extra expense consists in the
fees with which servants expect to be tipped at leaving.
Many persons refuse to give anything, on the strictly theoretically-correct
ground that they have already paid for service
in the bills. Such persons, at least if English people,
seem to be looked upon as shabby. On the other hand,
there are those, principally English, who are very lavish with
their largess, and really do their successors much harm,
leading the servants to be on the outlook for handsome fees.
In Italy the evil is, I think, most felt. In France, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it is bad enough. If one be but a single night at a hotel,
chamber-maid, waiters, <i>concierge</i>, porters, conductors, and
even drivers of omnibuses&mdash;all expect donations, and stand
hovering about (perhaps perform useless little services), that
they may not be lost sight of. Nor is the evil less at pensions,
where I have had more than once to fee no less than seven
attendants, being the whole menial establishment. It becomes
a very heavy tax, amounting to no small sum at the
end of a long tour, as one does not like to be shabby, or
thought so. At pensions and hotels at Christmas time, every
servant with whom the visitor has had to do expects his or
her five-franc piece at the least; and this really one does not
at that festive season so much grudge, if dwelling in the
house for the winter, although the feeing process has to be
repeated at leaving, and intermediately for any supposed
extra services. I must say, however, that the only suggestion
of a donation at Christmas came from the <i>portier</i> of our hotel
at Mentone, who addressed a lithographed card to each visitor
on the 1st of January: ‘Le portier de l’Hotel vous souhait
une bonne et heureuse année.’ And no doubt a similar
lithographed card was used with effect by all the porters of
the place, and made the ignorant or unthinking aware of
what they were expected to do.</p>

<p>The only person outside the establishment who suggested
a benefaction by the enclosure of a card was the postman,
who, no doubt, was cheerfully boxed by every visitor.</p>

<p>I suppose that complaints of this practice of tipping or
expecting fees reached the ears of the landlords, who, honest
men, no doubt had found their advantage in it; for, in the
summer of 1877, nine of the principal hotels in Switzerland
announced to the public that, with a view to putting a stop
to it, they should thenceforth make a charge which would
cover everything, so that visitors should not be annoyed
longer in this way. But the system which they did adopt
was an erroneous one, and was only calculated to place an
additional burden on their guests&mdash;in other words, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
made an extra charge for their rooms; so that the occupants
had to pay nightly, in some cases, perhaps as much as they
would have paid once for all as gratuity, while in many cases
gratuities would continue to be given. We came upon one
of these hotels, the Schweizerhoff in Lucerne. Here, in
conformity with the new rule, one charge was made for
rooms per night, inclusive of attendance and lights, and a
bill was stuck up in the rooms containing a notice in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘<i>Avis. Messieurs les étrangers sont priés de ne plus donner de pour
boires aux employés de l’Hotel. Toute le service dans l’intérieur de l’Hotel
ainsi que l’éclairage est compris dans le prix de l’appartement.</i>’</p>

<p class="p1">Such a notice was only valuable if it had borne that the
servants were <i>expressly prohibited</i>, upon pain of dismissal,
from taking any gratuity; but while it contained nothing
but what was always previously implied in the charge for
service, and left the charge for porterage of luggage as performed
<i>extérieur</i> (a service which has always been recompensed
by a gratuity, and which the porter here duly accepted),
the very form of the notice, ‘Pray, don’t,’ rather suggests the
idea that you ought to give. The evil is really so great that
a more efficient and beneficial method ought to be taken by
the hotels.</p>

<p>In Italy I have sometimes been asked for a gratuity by a
messenger from a shop on delivering a purchase made.</p>

<p class="p2">Hotel bills are usually rendered and paid once a week.
At Bellagio an admirable system was in use. Bills were
rendered every day, although payment was not expected
oftener than once a week. In this way any mistake could
at once be rectified; and we did find occasionally&mdash;as every
one must, especially in the touring season, when the sojourners
are daily shifting&mdash;rectification to be necessary. It would
be much in the interest of the landlords to make the practice
universal, because where any entry has been charged to the
wrong person, the person to whom it ought to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
charged may have left before discovery has been made. The
waiters write, sign, and deliver to the clerk a slip containing
every order, as the means of making up the books, and
sometimes, perhaps, from not wishing to give offence by
asking, put by mistake the wrong name to the order. In
London a better system is, where the guest is requested to
write the order himself, heading the memorandum with his
name and number. In some&mdash;I am bound to say, only a few&mdash;cases
in France, the landlord regularly charges his guests
with the penny Government receipt stamp on discharging
the bill. Honestly, this ought to be borne by himself.</p>

<p class="p2">Messrs. Cook and Gaze both issue hotel coupons. These are
made up as books of three per day. One portion covers bedroom,
lights, and service for one person; but it bears that porterage
is not included, and a charge for conveying luggage to and
from the bedroom to the door is then (I think erroneously)
occasionally made in the bill, though the doing so does not
exempt from the customary fee expected by the porters.
Another portion covers plain tea or breakfast; and a third,
dinner at <i>table d’hôte</i>, with or without wine, according to the
usual practice of the hotel. Cook’s tickets cost 8s., Gaze’s
cost 8s. 6d., but the latter entitle the holder to eggs or meat
at breakfast. The hotels of both firms are for the most part
unobjectionable, but the question is whether the coupons are
or are not of any real advantage. As to this, people who
have not used them are generally much puzzled. I had
never, in travelling abroad, tried them before, but thought,
upon entering Italy, where it is reputed (contrary to my
subsequent experience) that one requires to be upon his
guard against hotel imposition, I might make experiment to
a limited extent, and accordingly purchased enough at Nice
to last us about fourteen days.</p>

<p>On an average, I believe it will be found that, taking bedroom
accommodation at the lower rates, or as for the upper
<i>étages</i>, the price of the coupons is very much the same as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hotel charges would come to. In some hotels, in the smaller
places, the charges may occasionally come to a trifle less,
especially if there be a party; in others, in the larger towns,
the hotel charges will certainly exceed it. In a pecuniary
point of view, therefore, and supposing people are constantly
on the wing, they will find that upon the whole the saving
is not large, but that, in any view, there is a clear advantage
in using them in large and expensive towns such as Marseilles
and Nice.</p>

<p>However, if it be intended to stay long enough in a hotel
to warrant going upon pension, it can frequently be arranged
to obtain pension at the same rate as is payable for the
coupons, the effect of which is that lunch is thrown into the
bargain, saving 3 francs per day.</p>

<p>In Italy also the advantage of exchange is lost, the coupons
being only purchasable with English money.</p>

<p>The coupons save a little trouble and shorten the bills.
To those unable to speak a foreign tongue, they are additionally
valuable. On the other hand, I fear the traveller is a
good deal at the mercy of the landlord in regard to rooms.
It is quite in his power to say he has no better. But if the
house be not full, there is a possibility of being assigned the
best rooms, and so obtaining accommodation for which, without
coupons, a high charge would be made.</p>

<p>My limited experience gave me rather a dislike for them,
and led me to feel I was more independent, and had a chance
of being better served, by paying my way in the usual
manner. At a town in Italy, I mentioned on arrival, as is
required, that I had Cook’s coupons and intended to use
them. When the bill at leaving was rendered, I pointed
out that it had not been stated as on this footing. It turned
out that for the two nights we stayed at the house, the hotel
charges (we were most comfortable in every respect) came
to 6 francs 75 centimes less for our party than the cost of the
coupons. Yet the landlady looked black when I pointed
out the mistake, and seemed, while I was actually paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
more, as if she thought me imposing on her. I felt so
annoyed that I would never use them again in Italy.
Months afterwards, when in a town in Switzerland, I resolved
to employ what remained, and in driving up to the
hotel on Cook’s list, told the landlord so. I noticed he did
not seem to relish the intimation, and when we visited the
rooms allotted to us, we found them dismal chambers looking
into the courtyard. I rebelled, and we got cheerful and
better rooms on the floor above. This showed that we could
not always quite rely upon getting the best accommodation
possible, notwithstanding the coupons in this instance came to
more than we could have pensioned for at the hotel, according
to its own printed tariff. I afterwards learnt that the
reason of dislike is, that the London house has a small commission
(which is quite reasonable, and perhaps is not much
objected to), and that settlements with the hotelkeepers do
not take place for, it may be, some months after the bills
are incurred, which may produce considerable inconvenience
to some hotelkeepers. Were it possible to arrange for more
frequent, say monthly settlements, perhaps all cause of dissatisfaction
would be obviated, for otherwise the system
must be most advantageous to the hotels which are on the
London lists.</p>

<p>I must, however, put against these two instances, which may
be very exceptional, the fact that I had used the coupons
previously at two other hotels in Italy, and subsequently at
another in Switzerland, and another in France, and met
with every civility and attention, while they at once gave
us excellent accommodation. Friends also who have
frequently taken advantage of them, have told me that they
preferred them, and would always in travelling avail themselves
of the system.</p>

<p class="p2">To vary the monotony of the pension life, or from the
inherent idea that gaiety is essential to existence, the hotel
and pension keepers get up, from time to time, little entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in the <i>salons</i>. Of these, a dance is the most
frequent; but in place of a quiet dance in the drawing-room
to music on the piano by one of the guests, it seems to be
considered essential to hire a band of musicians. Perhaps
this practice is more in accordance with the French love
of noise and display; but it both occasions unnecessary
expense, and has less of the social about it. At other times
we have had a conjurer introduced to exhibit tricks of
magic. Manifestly he has not the same facilities as in a
room fitted up for the purpose, but the tricks were sometimes
novel, and interest people, particularly the young. On
other occasions we have had special musical evenings, and
at Interlachen a band of Tyrolese singers every now and
then, I think almost weekly, gave an entertainment at the
hotel; and as visitors at Interlachen are always changing,
the audience would for the most part be different. We
have also had little plays by strolling actors, and even
on one occasion a small attempt at operatic performance.
Perhaps, of all the entertainments by professionals, the most
novel to us and beautiful was what we witnessed at Sorrento.
We were then lodging at the Tramontano Hotel,
and one evening were informed that we should witness the
Tarantala Dance. Round one of the larger rooms chairs
were placed for the guests (numbering probably over sixty).
When all were assembled, of a sudden two dancers bounded
lightly into the room, quickly followed by other pairs&mdash;the
men dressed in white, with Roman sashes round the waist;
women in gay bodices and white skirts, all looking clean and
tidy, and very specially got up for the occasion. These
young people, to the number of eight, executed a most lively
dance to the music performed by others on mandolins, all
the dancers being armed with castanets, with which they
maintained an incessant click-clack, keeping time to the
music. The dance, perhaps invented and practised by
Terpsichore herself, and which it would require a master of
the art to describe, in general outline somewhat resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a Scotch reel, but with what I would call Italian variations.
It was sprightly and graceful, and the bright dresses added
much to the effect. There were several different varieties
of the dance, and between the dances we were favoured
with some national melodies. One most comical exhibition
consisted in the leader, who was a barber of the village,
fastening a loose piece of paper behind him, and with this
tail floating in the air, he danced or capered about, keeping
time to the music, all the others, girls as well as men,
running after him with lighted tapers, endeavouring to
set this novel tail on fire; but so rapid or rather jerky were
his movements, that the paper would not catch fire from the
lights, and after a long chase, exciting the constant mirth
of the onlookers, he escaped triumphant, and burnt his tail
to show it was inflammable. After this, and as a wind up,
one of the musicians&mdash;an Italian, of course&mdash;honoured
us, flavoured by some peculiar linguistic embellishments,
calculated to evoke an occasional smile, with first ‘Yankee
Doodle,’ and afterwards with a still more uncommon version
of ‘God save the Queen,’ upon which all the company, with
the exception (hardly commendable) of a few Americans
present, rose to their feet, and a choking feeling of home
and of loyalty thrilled through us to hear our national
anthem, so sung by foreigners, and so far, it seemed, after
our wanderings, from our native land. With this the performance
terminated, and the collection began, and was
evidently good. For it is by means of a voluntary collection
that these professional exertions are usually recompensed.
On one occasion, a conjurer, having made his
collection in the middle of his performance, brought round
the plate a second time, which was rather too much.</p>

<p>A more objectionable course to obtain remuneration has
sometimes been taken at Mentone, of asking the visitors to
buy tickets for a raffle. Of course, each visitor is expected
to take at least one ticket (costing usually, I think, 2 francs),
and some take a good many, especially when the tickets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unsold are set up to a sort of absurd auction, and people in
a spirit of fun keep bidding by small amounts against each
other. Looking to the proximity of Mentone to Monaco,
the origin of the practice may be divined, and it is rather
calculated to foster the spirit of gambling which prevails,
especially among foreigners, although the things raffled for
are necessarily worthless trifles, offering a purely nominal
value in exchange for the tickets of the fortunate prize-holders.
I presume it is done because it fetches more
money to the performers, although ostensibly to give the
aspect of not stooping to a collection. But as collections for
themselves are, twice a week at least, made abroad by clergymen
of the English Church by sending round the plate during
service, one can little see why a conjurer should be ashamed or
consider it <i>infra dig.</i> to receive payment in the same way.</p>

<p class="p2">The <i>entrée</i>, however, is not always <i>libre</i>. On one
occasion, at least, bills were sent round to different other
hotels that a <i>matinée musicale</i> would be held in one of the
Mentone Hotels&mdash;’<i>Entrée</i>, 6 francs <i>par personne</i>.’ In these
cases visitors from other houses are expected.</p>

<p class="p2">The guests themselves at the hotels and pensions frequently
devise amusement for the company. Sometimes it
consists in charades, more or less elaborately conducted,
according to circumstances. They are diverting, and create
great excitement among the performers in anticipation,
realization, and retrospect. In some hotels, there is at one
end of a large room a little permanent stage expressly fitted
up to enable charades or plays to be performed.</p>

<p>At other times we have had Shakespeare readings, the
different members of the party having assigned to each,
one or more of the characters of the play; but the difficulty
always was, by begging and borrowing, I won’t say stealing,
to procure a sufficient number of copies of the play, so that
each reader might have one. A handy copy of Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
is one of the books which those who go abroad for the
winter may with advantage take with them.</p>

<p>On another occasion, at Florence, we had a remarkably
nice series of miscellaneous readings by a gentleman of the
company. But the most elaborate performance, at least at
a hotel, was one at Chateau d’&OElig;x. Here some Americans
of the party arranged with showy dresses a very successful
performance of the play called ‘Popping the Question.’
It was capitally acted, and we felt only sorry that the
spectators were so comparatively few, although, to increase
the number, the performers had invited their friends living
in neighbouring pensions.</p>

<p class="p2">As I mention this last affair, it is impossible to omit in
this connection two grand entertainments we had at Mentone,
in the beginning of 1877, of a more public nature. These
were two dramatic performances by amateurs, drawn from
among the hotel visitors, the leading spirit being Captain
Hartley, who was himself a highly-finished actor. They were
held in the large room of the <i>cercle</i>, or club-house, which has
a regular small stage at the one end, and is capable of
accommodating between 200 and 300 people, and was hired
for the occasion. The performers invited their friends, and
so unexpectedly well did they turn out, that the room on
the first occasion was more than filled&mdash;many, indeed, could
not get within either sight or hearing. The performance
consisted of two pieces,&mdash;the first, ‘A Touch of Nature
makes the Whole World kin,’ and ‘Box and Cox.’ The
plays were executed to admiration. Nothing could have
been better than the acting, although it was painful to think
that some of the actors were invalids, and were evidently
straining their powers too much, and I fear hurt themselves
by doing so, and by the labour of getting up their parts and
attending rehearsals. But so successful was the performance,
that on 3d February the amateurs held another <i>matinée</i>,
on which occasion the ‘Porter’s Knot’ was acted, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gave an equal amount of satisfaction to all who could
witness it. These entertainments were exclusively at the
expense of the amateurs. In the following season their
success induced the having two more, which met with equal
applause.</p>

<p>On occasion of the first performance of all, the <i>Avenir</i>
(newspaper) of Mentone congratulated the fair little town
on its waking up from its torpor in a leading article, in the
course of which it said:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Nos sincères félicitations aux organisateurs de cette charmante fête.
Est-ce que Menton songerait enfin à s’amuser? Bravo, Messieurs!... reveillez
un peu cette ville que les autres se donnent tant de peine à endormir.
Egayez un peu cette riche colonie étrangère, veritable fortune pour notre beau
pays, il faut bien la choyer, l’amuser, et surtout faire de sérieux sacrifices,
pour la retenir éternellement sur les bords de cette splendide Méditerranée
sous les rayons de ce bienfaisant soleil, sous nos citronniers en fleurs, sous
notre beau ciel bleu&mdash;la nature a tout fait pour eux ... à vous de compléter
l’&oelig;uvre, à vous de les distraire: concerts, bals, spectacles. Voilà
l’&oelig;uvre que vous devez accomplir. La matinée de lundi est un bien jolie
commencement, continuez!’</p>

<p class="p1">Attached to nearly all season places, as well as to others
frequented by visitors, there is a band of music, which
during the season plays in public so many times a day, or
so many times a week. In some places it plays twice or
even three times a day. In Switzerland, which is a great
resort of the Germans, the music seems designed to promote
out-of-doors tippling, as the ground about the sheltering
pavilion in which the musicians play is dotted over with
chairs and little tables, at which these foreigners sit and
imbibe and listen, or are supposed to listen, to the strains of
the music. Nay, I have been told that the Germans also
order beef-steaks and other solids, although long time cannot
have elapsed since the last meal at the hotels, or it will not
be long till the next meal-time arrives. If one should sit
down on a chair, a waiter or waitress immediately comes
forward expecting an order. I do not recollect having seen
this custom prevailing anywhere in France except at the
Gardens in the Champs Elysée in Paris, where professedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the music is given in connection with and to promote the
drink. In Switzerland one has sometimes to pay for the
music in the shape of a regular daily or weekly tax, which
is stated in the hotel bill is authorized to be levied, and
which the visitor is bound to pay, although he may have
been deaf from his birth. We were required to make such
a payment at Ragatz at the Quellenhof Hotel, where the
band played morning and evening. At Interlachen, where
we spent nine weeks, I found it more advisable to pay for
the season, and it cost me 20 francs, which was practically a
payment by me towards the support of a German drinking
establishment, as I do not think during all the time I was
there I looked into the <i>Kursaal</i> more than four or five
times, and that merely to see if any friend were there. It is
unpleasant to those who cannot drink in season and out of
season, or who are not used to public potation, to go to such
places.</p>

<p class="p2">Not having had personal experience of life abroad in villas
or furnished rooms, I cannot say much upon this subject.
At all season places furnished villas abound, and apartments
are to be had, the cost of which necessarily depends upon
the locality and the accommodation. I see from the <i>Avenir
de Menton</i> of 12th December 1877, that one house-agent
advertised to have had then to let sixty-five villas in Mentone,
varying from four apartments, or <i>pièces</i>, as the French
term them, up to twenty-four, and ranging in price from 900
francs to 18,000 francs for the season. This list was published
after previous demands had been satisfied. How far those on
the list may subsequently have been taken up, I do not know;
but the season was considered to be a bad one, owing to the
general dulness of trade, the continuance of the Eastern War,
and the uncertainty as to the state of matters in France
arising out of the position held by the governing Powers
among themselves. Perhaps something also was due to the
fact that a good many new houses had since last season been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
built, so that there was an extra supply. The villas and
apartments are all let for the season; the owners will not let
them for a shorter period, because if they were to do so they
would run a great risk of not letting them for the remainder
of the winter. However, in a dull season somewhat less
than what is asked may be taken, and after a house has stood
empty for a time it may be had at a reduction. The season
at Mentone for so letting, I believe, is nominally eight months,
but in reality few people occupy the houses more than five,
or at most six months during the winter. During summer
months (from about the end of April) Mentone is deserted.</p>

<p>The cost per room seems to range from 200 francs to
nearly 800 francs, or about (taking five months’ occupation)
from 10 to 40 francs per week for each room. A small
family house may be had for about from 4000 or 5000 francs,
or from £150 to £200, the tenant obtaining nothing but the
rooms and furnishing. It is necessary for him to engage servants;
and I believe it is indispensable to have French servants
in addition to those the family taking the house may bring
with them, as English servants, not knowing the language,
could not be a means of communication with the natives.
These French servants are a source frequently of great
annoyance to their employers. They demand a high wage,
and as they are not employed during the whole year, perhaps
there is some reason for it. A lady at Hyères considered
herself particularly fortunate, as no doubt she was, in getting
a French servant at 45 francs per month, or at the rate of
nearly £24 per year. The amount asked, however, is, I
believe, usually very much more. But this is a small matter
as compared with other evils; for these servants expect
to be employed to make the purchases for the house, and
are, it seems, greatly chagrined if they learn that this duty
will not fall within their province. The lady of the house
may resolve to make her own purchases: she cannot, however,
always do so, and finds that she has generally to
devolve the work on one of the domestics; and hence, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
what I have heard, she often finds that the expense of
housekeeping becomes enormously heavy. This may probably
arise from the shopkeepers charging in excess in order
to afford a commission to the servants. One lady in Mentone,
with a family of three young children, who had two
English and two French servants, told me it cost her £16
for a single week of housekeeping, though it is possible
this may have been an extraordinary week. But this is not
all, for the family are exposed, unless they have very reliable
servants, to pillage by pilfering and otherwise. The same
lady had no doubt there were large quantities of bread and
other eatables given away by the servants to their friends,
or disposed of, as she could not possibly account otherwise
for the quantities which were said to be consumed. These
pilferings, however, were not confined to eatables. In <i>six
weeks</i>, on the house-agent going over the inventory, he made
out a bill for 98 francs for breakages. This included 30
plates, 3 teapots, and I know not what else beside. Of
course, it was incredible that such an amount of breakage
could have taken place even had Caleb Balderstone been in
the house, and in frequent fry. There were no traces of it;
there had been no report of it; the English servants had
never seen it. It was clear that the articles had been
appropriated or given away to friends. Such pilfering (of
which another friend also complained) may not be the rule&mdash;possibly
even is the exception; and one friend told me
they had most honest native servants. It is well, however,
to know that it is a possibility to be guarded against. One
of the best safeguards is, besides being very particular as to
the character of those engaged, to require them to sleep in
the house. If they do not sleep in the house, for which there
may not be sufficient room, they ought not to be allowed to
bring baskets with them when they come in the morning, to
take away when they leave at night.</p>

<p>One curious expense attendant upon the taking of a villa,
is a charge which was made by a house-agent at Mentone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
(I do not know if it be universal) for making out the inventory
of furniture. He charged the tenant 2½ per cent, upon
the rent; say, if the rent were £200, £5 for doing so was
charged against the tenant. This ought to be a proper charge
against the landlord exclusively, but no doubt the landlord
suffered a similar charge.</p>

<p class="p2">For two or three persons, it is upon calculation of the cost
much less expensive, and in every respect more desirable, to
take quarters in a hotel, where, if a servant be brought,
the usual charge for pension for her or him is 5 francs, or at
most 6 francs, and occasionally, though rarely, 4 francs per
day. But in the case of a large family, a villa is less expensive
and more convenient, especially if the children be
young, though it may require the family to be vigilant in
looking sharply after their foreign domestics.</p>

<p class="p2">While these foreign servants are not always trustworthy,
I must add this, that we have found no occasion whatever
in France or Switzerland to complain of dishonesty among
any of the domestics in any of the numerous hotels in which
we have been. We have had our things lying openly about,
and have never missed a single article, nor have we heard
of any other person suffering loss in this way.</p>

<p>The observation may not perhaps apply so thoroughly to
Italy. So much is heard of the petty thievery which prevails
in that country, especially in the southern portions of
it, that it is by no means proper to expose oneself more than
can be helped to lose in this manner; and we were more
than usually careful, while in Italy, not to throw temptation
in the way. At one house we missed two articles, viz. two
pairs of scissors, and could not but suspect that they had
been appropriated. It is, however, I suppose, rather the
railway men and the professed thieves whom people have
most to fear in Italy. One hears every now and then
of boxes being opened during railway transit and contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
taken, although this may be only in the case of luggage sent
by goods train, which in Italy should never be done. The
thievery is so open in Naples and surrounding places, that
we dared not leave anything exposed in a carriage. Nay, a
lady told me that a thief had even the audacity, before her
very eyes, to lift a bag out of the carriage in which she was
sitting.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>LOCAL MEANS OF CONVEYANCE.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">I happen</span> to have kept the billet of a Parisian cabman, on
which I find the number is 8973. I believe I have seen
<i>voitures</i> in Paris bearing a number higher than 10,000. In
all probability, however, there is not a licensed carriage to
represent each unit of this apparent grand total. When,
after many adventures and a long struggle, old age overtakes
the <i>voiture</i>, and a sudden jolt sends it to smash, a pious
regard may preserve the number to its shade; while the new
vehicle, its successor, may just be added on to the tail of the
list. But be this as it may, there is no lack of carriages of
all sorts in all Continental towns.</p>

<p class="p2">Elegant private equipages are to be seen in Paris and
other parts of France. These are often jobbed by English
people. At Nice the charge for a carriage, horses, and man
is £30 per month. But Nice is a notoriously expensive
place, and I doubt not that in other towns of France the
charge is greatly less. Dr. Johnson (p. 67) states that
carriages in Pau were to be had, with pair of horses and
driver, at £10 to £12 per month. His book, however, was
written in 1857, and possibly the charge since that time has
been raised.</p>

<p>But it is among the Italians, I think, that the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
appears more manifested for a good turn-out. In such large
towns as Genoa, Rome, or Naples, one sees hundreds of
beautiful carriages and fine horses. In fact, it would appear
that in Italy every woman aspiring to be considered a lady
must, at whatever sacrifice of other comforts, drive her
carriage and pair with liveried coachman and man-servant.
The Italians seem to consider that it is not <i>comme il faut</i>
for a lady to be seen walking,&mdash;for which, indeed, the climate
is not much suited,&mdash;and they are rather surprised at observing
English ladies going so much about on their own feet.
The public vehicles are also of so inferior a description, that
one can scarcely wonder at a resident lady being ashamed
to be seen in them. I fancy, too, that the expense is not so
great as with ourselves. Men-servants’ wages must certainly
be considerably less, and crops of hay are so abundant,
while agricultural labour is so miserably recompensed that
the expense of feeding is, no doubt, also much less than at
home. Moreover, horse flesh would appear to be greatly
cheaper in Italy than with ourselves. At Rome I asked
the driver of the carriage in which we went to Tivoli
what might be the cost of such a pair of horses as he was
driving. They were poor hacks, although they went well.
He said about 400 francs, or about £16. I pointed to a
handsome pair of horses standing in a private carriage upon
one of the streets of Rome, and asked him what they would
cost. He said from 1000 to 2000 francs, or from £40 to
£80. If this information can be relied on, horse flesh must
be cheap enough in Italy. I am not sufficiently skilled in
the subject to say whether the breeds are equal to our own,
though I doubt it; but they look very handsome animals, and
the Italians are careful to allow their tails to grow so as
often even to sweep the ground; and in this way the natural
grace and beauty of the horse is preserved, while it retains
the protection it has received from nature against the attacks
of flies, which are a great source of torment in some places.</p>

<p>The cart horses in France are sometimes fine, strong-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
beasts, but are scarcely equal to the more powerful
breeds of Britain, although I think they are made to draw
heavier loads; and these poor horses do discharge their
duty most heroically in spite of the brutal treatment they
often receive.</p>

<p class="p2">But present observation has rather to do with cabs or
carriages which ply for hire.</p>

<p>In France, great variety of carriage is to be had. In
such places as Biarritz, Nice, or Mentone, there are many
elegant landaus having nearly all the appearance of private
carriages, and, no doubt, most of them have been quite
recently in private occupation. They are kept in good
order and freshly painted, and are the best class. From
them there is a descent to various kinds of smaller and
inferior <i>voitures</i>. The close kind is generally of a very
shaky, antiquated construction; although in some places, such
as Lyons and Cannes, there is a kind of brougham plying
for hire of a better quality, narrow and confined, holding
two only, and even two with a squeeze, although some of
them (to be seen in Paris) have also a folding down seat for
a child. Other carriages have a hood. In Paris, where
people are exposed to sudden showers of rain, the one-horse
open carriages have an extraordinary huge kind of hood
which can be promptly raised, but when turned over, falls
so low as almost to extinguish the occupant and to exclude
his view; but even then, and with a leathern apron drawn
up over the knees, I have found in a storm that adequate
protection against rain is not secured. One of the nicest of
light vehicles in use is a kind of basket carriage, seated for
four, or for two with a <i>vis-à-vis</i> folding down seat for one or
for two more behind the box, the box seat sometimes holding
a fifth, and occasionally there is a light miniature rumble
behind holding another. These are drawn for the most part
by a pair of smart horses, remarkably small, akin to the
active little Exmoor ponies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The horses always go most willingly, and the drivers
delight in urging them at top speed. Regardless of consequences,
they dash down a hill in a way which would
make an English coachy’s hair stand on end, and like a
cannon ball through a crowd, without halting or swerving
from their course, expecting the crowd to scatter right and
left to make way for them. This is all done to the noise
of a horrid ear-splitting cracking of the whip. The driver
cracks his whip, and considers that having done so, he is
discharged of responsibility, and that it is the pedestrian’s
own fault if he be run over; just as a golfer considers that
when he has cried ‘faar’ before striking his ball, it is the
fault of the person struck that he has not got promptly
enough out of the way. This cracking of the whip goes on
incessantly while the man is with his horse, and even when
without, and seems indulged in most frequently from a
boyish love of making the odious noise.</p>

<p>There is great variety in these cracks. The crack of the
heavy carter’s whip differs from that of the coachman’s
lighter one. There is the single crack, the double or back
and fore crack, and the multiple crack, this last being like
the dancing noise produced by those alarming crackers
placed by mischievous urchins on a Queen’s Birthday night
under the garments of terrified young women. There is the
encouraging crack, supposed to cheer the horse on his way;
the crack direct, when the driver applies the lash; the practising
crack, when he practises for perfection in this ravishing
art; the thoughtless crack, when done in vacancy from mere
force of habit; the warning crack, when he wishes pedestrians
to yield the smooth part of the road, that he may avoid the
rough, or simply that he, the dominant power, may maintain
majestically his straight undeviating course; the angry
crack, when the supposed humble pedestrian, being an
Englishman, disregards the warning crack, thinking that he
has as good a right or a better to pursue his way, there
being room enough to pass by making a slight deviation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
from the straight; the annunciating crack, particularly
affected by town omnibuses to intimate their approach; and
the crack jubilant, employed by the hotel omnibuses when,
having bagged a man, the driver thus expends all his bottled-up
rapture and announces the joyful event on nearing the
door of his hotel. The crack may indicate a cracked driver
or a crack one, according as it is the passers-by or the driver
himself who forms the opinion, and it is an obviously
enviable accomplishment which many can manage with their
left hand. The poor horses are expected to disregard all
cracks but the crack direct, and to appearance do so; but I
can’t help thinking that the horrid din is to the animal very
much what the buzz of the mosquito is to man, not a <i>malum
in se</i>, but a sound which proclaims the existence of a torment
which at any moment may descend upon its hide.
The singular thing, too, is that this noise does not seem to
disturb the equanimity either of the driver’s own horse or
of the other passing horses. With our own high-spirited
horses, the mere wag of the whip will make them frantic,
and I believe there would be no holding in English horses
in a Continental town. Whether it be that the foreign
horses are not so high metalled, or get used to the noise, as
horses do to passing trains, I do not know, but to the walkers
along the streets it is an intolerable nuisance; nor is it
altogether without its dangers, as on one occasion a lady of
our party all but got her eye struck by a flying lash. The
same sort of cracking goes on in Italy; but I noticed that
in Florence and Rome, and particularly the latter city,
the drivers did it very seldom. Probably to do so was
against some police regulation, as from the large number
of vehicles with which the streets of Rome are filled, the
noise would be deafening, and might even be dangerous.</p>

<p class="p2">I was at first inclined to think that the Italian coachmen
are kinder to their horses than the French or Swiss. It was
long ere I saw an Italian behaving savagely to his horse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
but I have observed it, and been informed by others of the
cruel treatment they have seen practised by Italians. I
have seen men behaving most savagely to their horses in
France and Switzerland. For example, I have frequently
seen a carter, or man in charge of a horse or donkey, when
he wished it to move on, instead of quietly speaking to
it, as even an English carter would, take the butt end of his
heavy whip and lay heavily on the poor animal’s back, or
even give it a violent kick. The carters lade their carts
very heavily, and often&mdash;I might even say always&mdash;beyond
the strength of the horse. I have observed a poor horse
struggling with all his might to pull the improper load up
a hill, the carter encouraging it by the whip all the time.
Several times I could not resist speaking to the men about
their conduct. On one occasion, at Cannes, I saw a horse,
after having struggled to the utmost of his strength with a
load twice as heavy as it ought to have been (the bystanders
only looking on and giving it no aid), and remaining willing
but helpless to do more, when the carter took the narrow end
of his heavy whip, and came down twice with his whole force
with the heavy-loaded butt end on his horse’s head. Ere he
could repeat the villanous stroke, I rushed forward, arrested
his hand, and told him, in the best French I could muster,
what a brute I thought him to be. But it is not easy to give
vent to one’s indignation in a foreign tongue. The fellow
ought to have been prosecuted, and there does exist in France
a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but
policemen as well as others, I suspect, are as callous to such
offences as our own policemen are to the destruction by boys
of our meadow or park trees. Cruelty to a horse, however,
often consists in little aggravating acts which a prosecution
might fail to reach. I have often seen a coachman waiting
at a stand, or at a door, and, having idle hands, mischievously
proceed to touch up his horses for doing nothing&mdash;in
short, to vent his own irritation at his idleness upon
the poor dumb animals; and then, when they began to caper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
because of the whip, the whip was again applied because
of the caper. However, I am afraid this is an evil habit
which is not seldom to be witnessed in our own country.
Another method abroad of torturing the horse is by the use
of a bearing rein strapped up to the high and heavy saddle
or collar borne by the cart horses, which from its weight is
also of itself an infliction. But so long as Liverpool dray
horses are so tortured, we cannot reasonably complain of
bearing reins as a foreign peculiarity. A more extraordinary
and hardly credible kind of torture a lady told me
she had witnessed was in the passing of a strap or rope
through the skin of the horse, compelling him to move on
to avoid or lessen the pain so produced. I would fain
believe she had been mistaken, but she was one on whose
relation I could rely, and whose capacity for observing could
scarcely be questioned.</p>

<p class="p2">The Italian carriages for hire are very inferior to the
French. At Naples they are of the roughest possible kind&mdash;open
little phaetons made of coarse wood, at some
remote period having enjoyed a coat of paint, and exhibiting
a barely decent seat for two, and a little folding seat
for a third. The Roman carriages are similarly constructed,
but a shade better. The drivers in Naples and its vicinity
are, as regards person and clothes, the dirtiest-looking ragamuffins.
One shrinks to come in contact with them. In
Rome, on the other hand, the drivers are generally a respectable-looking
class, and they wear a black glazed hat and
red cloth waistcoat. The most stylish of coachmen we
have seen are those at Biarritz, where they frequently
mount a grand blue broidered jacket with scarlet facings;
but this grandeur has to be paid for.</p>

<p class="p2">At Castellamare and the district round about in the Bay
of Naples, and elsewhere in the south of Italy, the horses’
heads are decorated with long pheasant feathers, which give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
them a jaunty look; while in most places the generality of
horses have fastened to their collars a string of small bells
which keep a continual lively jingle,&mdash;genial, doubtless, to
the animals,&mdash;and are as pleasant as the cracking of whips
is odious. About Sorrento, the carriages are often drawn
by three horses abreast, three being charged the same as for
two. It seems a waste of power, the only explanation
given for which was that the horses are not strong. Whatever
may be the case in this respect, the horses in Italy
always go with the greatest spirit, never seeming to require
the lash. I fancy that the jingle of the bells operates as a
stimulant. It was very cheery, sitting in our parlour at
Sorrento, to hear every now and then the jingle of the bells
announcing an arrival or a departure.</p>

<p class="p2">Carriage fares for drives about town are moderate almost
everywhere. They are more in France than in Italy.
Bædeker generally states in his guide-books what the fares
are at each town. Although on the whole correct, they
are not always to be relied on, probably because of alterations
on the tariffs. Sometimes a board or bill of the tariffs
is hung up in the carriage, and in some places, such as
Paris, the driver is obliged to give the hirer his number on
a ticket which specifies the fares. In Paris a one-horse
carriage is charged 1·85 per course and 2·50 per hour
during the day, and 2·50 and 3 francs respectively during
<i>nuit</i>, or the hours of darkness. A little more is charged
if the <i>voiture</i> be taken from the <i>remise</i>, that is, the stables.
There do not appear to be two-horse carriages plying for
hire upon the streets of Paris. When one is wanted, it
must be sent for to the stables, and I believe that the
charge is heavy. Fares in Paris, however, are higher than
in the provinces. At Lyons the fare per course is 1·25;
if taken by the hour, it is only 1½ francs per hour in the
city, and the same at Pau, but at Mentone and elsewhere
fares are rather more. A large carriage with two horses is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at Mentone 1·75 per course and 3·50 per hour during the
day, and 2 francs and 3·75 respectively during <i>nuit</i>. A
one-horse carriage is 1·25 per course and 2·50 per hour
during the day, and 25 centimes more after dark. If, however,
one has to ascend a height in a town, he is sure to
have to pay extra. For example, we were charged extra for
ascending Fourvières at Lyons, and the Chateau at Nice,
although driving per hour. If there be more than a single
place to go to, it is always cheaper to take the carriage by
the hour. If when driving by the course a stoppage be made
by the way, it is not unusual to charge as for two courses.
At the same time, Continental drivers are quite up to the
trick of English coachmen, when put upon hour-driving, of
crawling along. We were somewhat amused at Sorrento
(where the horses are invariably put upon full speed), upon
taking a carriage by the hour to Massa, a few miles off, to
see how the man leisurely walked his horse the whole way.
Nor, in this instance, did we grudge it; because the scenery
was so lovely that we had full time to enjoy it, and the
rapid whisking through it, which otherwise would have
taken place, would have given us but a passing glimpse.</p>

<p>In Italy the cab fares are exceedingly moderate. For
instance, at Genoa, Florence, and Rome, the drive per course
is only 80 centessimi (8d.). At Rome, for every person
beyond two, 20 centimes (2d.) additional is payable. The
charge per hour is 1·50. At Naples, fares are even more
moderate. The course, according to Bædeker, is 60 centimes
per hour, 1·40 the first hour and 50 centimes every
half-hour after; but we found the actual tariff was slightly
more.</p>

<p>One requires to be careful, especially in Italy, about
driving per hour in a town, not to go unnecessarily beyond
its bounds, as when this is done the tariff is no longer binding,
and the fare may be completely at the mercy of the driver.
Thus, at Florence, we had on one occasion taken a carriage
by the hour, and after driving about for some time, went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Fiesole, which lies beyond the bounds. When we came to
settle with our driver, he charged us three or four francs
additional on this account. At Naples, where one may very
easily exceed the bounds, I was amused at the pertinacity
of a driver in suggesting to go to places just beyond the city;
but as I had made myself acquainted with its limits, and had
no wish at that time to go to the places he named, I
declined. The way to adopt when designing to go beyond
the bounds is, as we arranged always at Rome, to make an
express bargain that the charge by time should cover wherever
we went.</p>

<p class="p2">It is a custom on the part of the drivers, notwithstanding
their fares are fixed or agreed upon, to expect over and
above what they call in France and Switzerland a <i>pour
boire</i>, and in Italy <i>buono manu</i>. This is a provoking
addition to a regulated fare. No doubt it is left in the
discretion of the traveller, and he may give as much as he
pleases, although it is said that in Italy the giving of too
much is often regarded as symptomatic that the giver is soft
and may fairly be asked for more. But the giving of too
little will at once meet with a remonstrance. It is frequently
a difficulty to know exactly what it should be.
It is expected as a matter of right by the French coachman;
it is begged for by the Italians. The best course is always
to arrange, in the case of a special drive, that the charge
bargained for shall include everything, as the French express
it <i>tout compris</i>; and if you are pleased with the man’s
attention, any gratuity over and above will be unexpected.
But in Italy, even although you have arranged upon the
footing of <i>tutti compressi</i>, the driver will sometimes beg for
a <i>buono manu</i>. So accustomed are they to this description
of beggary, that I have seen a coachman, before he even
knew what I had put into his hand (which was a half franc
more than his fare upon a short ride upon the footing of
<i>tutti compressi</i>), beg for a <i>buono manu</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The fares which are charged for going to given places beyond
a town, are often out of all proportion to the fares within
town&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if charged according to the time occupied, they
would be greatly in excess of a time charge. It is difficult
to understand a good reason for this, as in town they might
be standing long idle for chance fares; while going to a given
place, occupying so many hours, is just so much constant
employment. Nor is it constant driving, because nobody
goes to see a place without stopping at it for some time, and
perhaps even making other stoppages by the way. It is
just a custom to expect a ‘fat job’ out of such a drive. One
owes it no less to oneself than to those who come after, not
to give too much, and really sometimes the fares asked are
exorbitant. For instance, when we wanted a carriage to go
from Interlachen to Chateau d’&OElig;x (which we accomplished
in twelve hours, stopping by the way from two to three
hours for dinner, and with several other stoppages of same
duration, and going at a rate seldom exceeding five miles
per hour), one man wanted 150 francs, or £6; others, 100
francs. I ultimately arranged with a man for 90 francs,
with a <i>pour boire</i>, which came to 5 francs more. So little
fatigued were his horses, that they were driven back to
Interlachen next morning, and in all probability a return fare
was obtained for at all events part of the way. The sum
charged for these journeys includes the feeding of man and
horses, and all hotel charges in connection with the vehicle,
which are borne by the owner of the carriage, and cost him
little, although, were they paid by the traveller, a large
addition would be made to the expense&mdash;a method of
arrangement which ought to be universal. The fares are
computed by distance on some odd and unequal principle.
I was told afterwards that if we had taken the boat on Lake
Thun to Spiez, or about an hour’s distance from Interlachen,
I could have had a carriage from Spiez to Chateau d’&OElig;x
for about one-half what I paid from Interlachen.</p>

<p>It is principally at the Swiss Passes, however, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
exorbitant fares are demanded. For example, at Bellagio,
the hotel charge for a carriage and pair from Colico to Coire,
where there is a railway to Zürich, is 200 francs; 300 francs
for three horses, without which it is hardly possible to ascend
the mountains; and 380 francs for four horses. The journey
involves&mdash;the first day, about three hours’ travelling by coach
from Colico to Chiavenna, where we slept; ten hours the
second day, ascending by zig-zags to the top of the mountain,
and then down to Splugen, and halting two or three hours
out of the ten at Campo Dolcino for rest and lunch; and
the third day, starting from Splugen at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, getting by a
gentle descent through the Via Mala, and stopping two or
three hours at Thusis for lunch, we reached Coire about
4 o’clock, or eight hours altogether. As I knew that the
fares asked were excessive, I went by steamboat to Colico a
day previous to our leaving, and readily arranged, after
some bargaining, for an excellent carriage and good pair of
horses, with a third for the mountains (we actually had four
part of the way) for 150 francs, with the inevitable <i>buono
manu</i>. When we reached Splugen, finding that a gentleman
who accompanied us was going to Ragatz, I proposed we
should go there too, instead of proceeding from Coire to
Zürich by railway. Our friend unfortunately spoke about
it to the landlord, who immediately impressed on our
coachman, who was also the proprietor of the carriage, that
the proper fare for the additional distance was 35 francs, a
distance which I afterwards found took us less than two
hours to accomplish (it was down hill most of the way).
I refused to give such a figure for the addition to our drive,
as we could have gone by rail for a few francs; but on
nearing Coire, I spoke to the driver and arranged to give him
30 francs additional, inclusive of the <i>buono manu</i>, for the
whole journey, which we thought would require to be from
12 to 15 francs. It was too much, but it saved stopping
an hour at Coire for a train and shifting our luggage. So
confirmed, however, is the habit of asking a <i>buono manu</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that, in the face of my express arrangement after paying
the man his 180 francs, he had the assurance to ask me
for it.</p>

<p class="p2">It is always best, on going a long drive, to make a very
express and explicit arrangement, and in Italy to make it
in writing, so that there may be no room for mistake or
dispute; and it is also well to see the carriage and horses
you are to have, and to make sure the horses are properly
shod. Generally, it is better to arrange for a carriage oneself.
For instance, the landlord of our hotel at Castellamare said the
charge for a carriage to Pompeii would be 12 or 15 francs.
I arranged for one for 8 francs. At the same place, his
charge was 10 francs to Sorrento, exclusive of <i>buono manu</i>,
which would be 2 francs more. As I knew I could easily
get a carriage for less, I told him I would not give more than
8 francs, with <i>buono manu</i>, and the carriage was at once
sent for; but even this was more than the fare mentioned
in Bædeker (6 francs). On return from Sorrento, we paid
only 8 francs altogether, the regular charge, the landlady
of the Tramontano, a clever and attentive Irishwoman,
telling us that she made it an express arrangement with
the coachman, adding, ‘What was the sense of paying more,
when we had arranged for a given sum?’ In going any
distance, it is always well to make inquiry of those who
may know something on the subject as to what the fares
ought to be, and as to the route.</p>

<p>Sometimes hotelkeepers make such excessive demands
as practically to be prohibitive. Thus at Baveno we found
the charge for a carriage and pair for a simple drive to be
8 francs the first hour and 5 francs for each hour thereafter.
At Chateau d’&OElig;x, in other respects one of the
cheapest places we have visited, we were told by some of
the young people at the hotel, that, wishing to go one
evening to have a dance at a neighbouring pension in the
village, not an eighth of a mile distant, but on an acclivity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the hotelkeeper asked for the double drive no less than
20 francs. They therefore gave up the idea of going.
The only possible excuse for this exorbitant demand might
be, that the road was rough for night driving, but carrying
a couple of lamps would have put that all right.</p>

<p class="p2">Fares everywhere have, however, been increased of late
years. Speaking from recollection, I think that at Interlachen,
for a drive which is now charged 25 francs, we
were charged fifteen years previously only 15 to 18 francs,
and other charges in proportion.</p>

<p class="p2">It used to be considered that for four persons it was at
least as cheap to take a carriage as to pay for four places
in a diligence. If this was so formerly, it is no longer so,
as it is less expensive to go by diligence. I imagine that
the fares by diligence either have not been increased, or
have been only slightly raised. We paid for the journey
from Lucerne to Interlachen, inclusive of steamboats on
the lakes of Lucerne and Brienz, 13 francs 90 centimes
each for inside places and cabin, the journey taking 10
hours; from Chateau d’&OElig;x to Aigle, occupying about 4½
hours of mountain travelling, 8 francs 25 centimes. In
either case it would have cost us considerably more to
have hired. Bædeker mentions the diligence fares from
Coire to Colico to be for <i>coupé</i> 27 francs 90 centimes, and
for <i>intérieur</i> 24·50; so that for four passengers travelling by
diligence, the fare would not exceed 112 francs; for six
passengers, 168 francs, instead of the 300 or 380 francs
demanded by the hotels, which no doubt affords them
a heavy profit. Travelling by diligence is, however, not
always desirable, as often part of the journey may have to
be performed during night, or at uncomfortable hours.
Diligences are now nearly driven off the field by the
railways, except in such countries as Switzerland. The
Swiss <i>Indicateur</i> contains a long list of the diligence routes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and their time bills, and <i>Continental Bradshaw</i> furnishes a
still longer list under the head, ‘Diligences, Post and Mail
Coaches, Germany, Switzerland, and North Italy,’ with, in
most cases, the fare payable.</p>

<p class="p2">I do not think that steamboat travelling is cheap&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
we paid 7 francs each on the Lake of Geneva from
Montreux to Geneva, taking three hours. On Lake Como the
fare from Bellagio to Como, about two hours, was 2 francs
80 centimes, or about 5s. there and back. From Sorrento to
Capri and back was 5 francs. I received a curious answer
from the captain of the steamboat to Capri to my question
what would be the fare to go from Sorrento to Naples; he
replied, ‘Whatever you please.’ We were informed at
Sorrento that if one of the two rival boats which usually
go from Naples to Capri do not sail, the passengers are
in the power of the boat which does sail, and may be asked
for what the captain pleases, which is sure to be something
different from what pleases the passenger.</p>

<p>The sailings of the steamboats are to be found in the
<i>Indicateurs</i>. On Lake Como a convenient little flyleaf
guide for the lake sailings is sold on board at the price of
5 centessimi (one halfpenny).</p>

<p class="p2">Most towns have their town omnibuses. In Paris there is
a system of ‘correspondence,’ by which the passenger leaves
his omnibus at certain stations and gets (with the same
ticket) into another to prosecute his route. But this correspondence
is puzzling to a stranger, who will always find it
better to take a cab and drive direct to his destination.</p>

<p class="p2">Tramways are beginning to be introduced, with carriages
similar to our own, but are generally placed in streets where
they will as little as possible interfere with other traffic.</p>

<p>In some towns of Italy, such as Milan, there are laid
stone-ways, being two parallel courses of flat stones, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
course perhaps about a foot broad, embedded in the causeway
and on the same level, on which the wheels of carts and
carriages run smoothly. It has sometimes struck me that
such a system of stone tramways without grooves, on
which all carriages could run, and which would not catch
their wheels, would be preferable for the streets of hilly
cities at home, for which tram rails, especially in its busy
thoroughfares, are entirely unsuitable. All the smoothness
of the tramway would be obtained without its danger to
life, its injury to carriages, and its interference with ordinary
traffic; while the huge, clumsy, box-looking, road-filling
cars would give place to a set of light omnibuses of
sufficient number. The luxury of travelling a mile in a
larger car could not be placed in the balance.</p>

<p class="p2">There are other means of conveyance, such as donkeys
and gondolas, which will be more appropriately referred to
when I come to speak of the places where they are used.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">By</span> treaty agreement, the postage rates for the Continent are
now very much reduced from what they used to be, and are
comparatively moderate, although to those who write much
the expense becomes in the aggregate a considerable item
of travelling expenditure. Single postage from England
to France, Switzerland, and Italy, and I think to most Continental
countries, is 2½d., and to this rate the Continental
countries on letters to England conform as nearly as their
coinage permits. But in France and Italy, taking advantage
of the fact that a franc is between 9½d. and 10d., they
charge 30 centimes, or about 3d.;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> so that the price of four
stamps in these countries is close upon 1s., instead of being
10d., as with ourselves. Single postage on letters for the
Continent covers one-half ounce in England; abroad it
covers 15 grammes, which seems to be the precise equivalent.
Little pocket letter-weighers are sold in France at 1 franc
and 1½ francs, containing a scale marked in grammes by
which letters can be conveniently weighed, and for prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
residence are all but indispensable. If a letter posted in
England be insufficiently stamped, the post office abroad
charges the recipient with double the postage the letter
ought to have borne according to the foreign rate, deducting
the amount of the stamps which it carries. Thus, if a
person in England put by mistake a penny stamp upon a
single letter, the French Government charge double the 30
centimes and deduct the penny paid, so that the recipient
has to pay 5d. upon the letter. If the letter have been
stamped with 2½d. postage, but exceeds the half ounce, the
recipient pays 1s., less the 2½d., or 9½d. altogether (more
correctly, 95 centimes). It is astonishing how many
blunders friends at home make in this respect. Over and
over again have we had to pay for them. If people are not
acquainted with the foreign postage, they ought to study
the postal guides, and in event of any difficulty to make
inquiry at a post office. One lady told me she had summed
up what these mistakes had cost her in one winter, and
found they came to 11 francs.</p>

<p class="p2">Newspapers posted in England require a penny stamp, but
abroad are reckoned by weight. The small Continental papers
go for 5 centimes, or one halfpenny; but in France, at least,
English newspapers always cost one penny or 10 centimes.</p>

<p class="p2">The rate in France for registering a letter to England is
5d. (50 centimes), while it was 4d. in England, being
another instance of the way in which the French take
advantage of the small difference between our monetary
values. The reduction in England of fee to 2d. applies to
foreign as well as inland letters.</p>

<p class="p2">Letters for the interior are always less than for abroad.
In France, where postage is high, the rate was 25 centimes
(now 15 centimes) to any part of France except the district
in which the letter was posted, when it was 15 centimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
possibly now less. For book delivery in town, the French
have a 2 centimes rate, and in Italy there is a similar rate
for newspapers for the interior.</p>

<p class="p2">Post cards are usually one-half of letter rates. Thus a
French post card to England is 15 centimes (1½d.), as against
our 1¼d. But in Switzerland, where postage is cheap,&mdash;there
being half rates for letters,&mdash;and in Italy, post cards
for England are only 1d. (10 centimes). English people
always familiarly call a 10 centime piece a penny, which
in size as well as in value it resembles.</p>

<p class="p2">Letters are, I think, delivered with great accuracy. I
have only known of two letters which have not reached us
during the whole time we were away, and one of these was
misaddressed. Newspapers, on the contrary, have not, in
France, reached us with the same regularity as letters.
This has been attributed to the French Government being
jealous of newspapers from Great Britain containing animadversions
upon its policy, and during the French crisis of the
autumn of 1877, we regularly missed a <i>Scotsman</i>, once a
week, sometimes of a Tuesday, but more commonly of a
Thursday, when, if there were no leading article touching
upon the French Government, we fancied it might contain
some gleanings from <i>Punch</i>. As <i>Punch</i> carries a free lance
and hesitates not to strike whatever is vulnerable, it is,
I suppose, fully more exposed to be stopped than any
ordinary newspaper; but in spite of precaution, it finds its
way abroad even when stopped.</p>

<p>The stoppage of newspapers, while it can do no manner
of good, produces a good deal of irritation and ill-will on
the part of the English. I believe that the attention of the
French Parliament has been called to it, and latterly we
found greater regularity. Of course, in many cases newspapers
may miscarry from addresses being insufficient or
getting torn off. It is always safer to write on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
newspaper itself; and if a cover be used, the newspaper
stamp must not connect the cover with the paper, otherwise
it is liable to be charged as a letter.</p>

<p class="p2">When the hotel at which to stop has been decided upon,
it is best to direct letters to be delivered at it. If not so
fixed upon, it is usual to address letters to the <i>Poste
Restante</i>, where they are got upon exhibition of a visiting
card; but in some places the post is very particular, and
perhaps rightly so. Thus, in San Remo, I was desired to
give my card to the <i>facteur</i> (postman) in whose beat our
quarters were, and the letters would be delivered at the
house. In Paris, I was refused letters for my wife without
a written authority from her. In other large towns, the
rule is to ask for passport; and if the inquirer have no
passport, he must prove his identity in a manner satisfactory
to the post clerk, as by exhibition of envelopes of letters
received elsewhere, or otherwise&mdash;regulations most reasonable
for the security of the recipients.</p>

<p class="p2">Registered letters are treated with peculiar care. In
France, the postman declines to give up such a letter except
into the hand of the person to whom it is addressed, who
signs his name in a book kept for the purpose, with date of
reception, etc. If he do not happen to be in the house at
the time, the postman takes away the letter, marks ‘absent’
upon it, and brings it back at succeeding deliveries till he
find him. In Italy, they are even more particular. At
Milan, I received at the hotel an intimation from the
post office that a registered letter was lying there for me.
In order to procure this letter, I was under the necessity
of going personally to the post office, a good way off, and
of taking with me a certificate by a resident in Milan of my
identity. I knew nobody residing in Milan, but the landlord
of the hotel was kind enough to sign the document.
Delivering this document, I was also required to exhibit my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
passport to the post office, and then to sign my name in
a book kept there for the purpose. These precautions,
although troublesome to the traveller, make registered
letters very secure; and all letters transmitting money
orders ought to be registered and put in firm, tough
envelopes, for I believe that letters are sometimes lost in
consequence of the thinness of the foreign letter envelopes
in which, for the sake of lightness, they are generally
enclosed.</p>

<p class="p2">On leaving a town, the new address should be given to
the post office or to the <i>concierge</i> of the hotel, and letters
will then be readdressed and forwarded free of charge.
Occasionally, we have found them forwarded to three or
four successive addresses before receipt by us, and that
without any extra payment, which would not be the case in
England. Nay, I have discovered, though only after many
postages had unfortunately been paid on the readdress in
England, that letters arriving in England from a colony,
say New Zealand, may be readdressed to the address abroad
without charge,&mdash;a fact, therefore, well worthy of being
noted. After a lapse of time, whether done by the post
office at request of the landlord or <i>concierge</i> of the hotel or
not, we could not tell, letters have been opened and returned
to the writers, from whom we have received them reinclosed
and restamped about a month after we had left the place to
which they were originally addressed.</p>

<p class="p2">Tradesmen, on seeing arrivals announced in the lists, send
in their business cards; and a circular of this kind, posted
to our hotel at Cannes, stamped with 15 centimes district
postage, was forwarded to us at Mentone. On this, 25
centimes (2½d.) had to be paid, showing a difference in the
treatment of interior letters, which may be explained in this
way, that the letter was not originally insufficiently stamped,
and there was not, therefore, excuse for charging it double.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The French have a good system in regard to letter
pillars which might with advantage be adopted by ourselves.
When the postman has made his collection from the pillar
box, he turns a dial, which indicates that that particular
collection has been made; <i>e.g.</i>, suppose he has taken the
first collection upon a Wednesday, the dial bears: ‘Mercredi,
la première levée est faite.’ And this is particularly necessary
in France, because the postmen are by no means
particular in adhering to the time fixed for making the
collection. Day after day have I seen the notice up
half an hour before the collection was due, obliging one
either to post early, or to go to the general post. The
French letter pillars are small wooden boxes stuck upon a
wall, pretty well out of reach of mischievous urchins; but
their slits are very narrow, and will not admit of an
ordinary English newspaper.</p>

<p class="p2">French postmen, for protection and security, carry their
letters for delivery in a box suspended by a strap round the
neck like a pedlar’s tray, and registered letters are kept in
a separate pocket or portion of the box. The newspapers
and book packets (often immense bundles) are simply
carried bound together by a strap.</p>

<p class="p2">It is astonishing with what rapidity letters and newspapers
are received from home. London newspapers are
received at Biarritz on the afternoon of the day following
publication. At Venice it takes a day longer, and some
places not so distant are, in consequence of the arrival of
the post late in the evening, just as long. Thus, while the
London newspapers are delivered at Nice the evening of the
day after publication, they are not delivered at Mentone
till the following morning, because they arrive after the
last postal delivery at Mentone. When the mail is accelerated,
as no doubt it will be in time, this delay will be
remedied; but the practical effect is that letters and newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
posted in Edinburgh upon a Monday before five
o’clock are delivered in Nice upon Wednesday evening, but
are not delivered in Mentone until Thursday morning. At
Venice or Rome they are delivered on the Thursday.
Letters posted on a Saturday are always one day longer, in
consequence of there being no despatch from London on the
Sunday; so that, leaving Edinburgh on Saturday, they are
not delivered in Mentone till Wednesday morning. Newspapers
are often a post later, and not delivered till the
second or evening delivery; for in Mentone, as in many other
places, there are only two deliveries in the day.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>SUNDAY ABROAD.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> is kept abroad with various degrees of propriety.
As a rule, it is a gala day&mdash;a fete day, and to certain
classes of servants it only brings additional toil. There is
no distinction, as with ourselves, unless in rare and exceptional
cases, between railway trains on Sunday and trains
on week-days; and, in point of fact, I believe there is more
travelling on Sundays than on other days of the week.
Work and business are not wholly suspended, but there
are fewer carts upon the streets. In many places, workmen
may be seen engaged in their employments, at
all events till dinner-time, just as usual. Shops are
nowhere wholly closed, at least during the earlier part of
the day. But the generality of the natives attend
a morning service, and afterwards walk about in their
Sunday clothes; so that in large towns the streets are
crowded by lounging saunterers, or scarcely less idle sightseers.
It is gratifying to observe that wherever English
people form a large admixture of the population, as at
Cannes, Mentone, and Pau, a greater external reverence is
paid to the day than elsewhere, and particularly in the
matter of closing shops. Possibly in some cases this may
result from finding it is not worth while to open them,
as the principal customers would not enter and transact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but let us hope that it springs from a growing influence
for good. In Paris, during and after the reign of the
Commune, I believe all shops were open; but they are
now, year by year, getting to be more and more closed.</p>

<p class="p2">In Mentone the washerwomen appear to suspend operations
on Sundays. It is probable that they strive to get
all the linen committed to their care sent home by the
end of the week to the ladies, who require their things
by that time to be ready. But I have occasionally seen
one or two washing away as usual, even in heavy rain;
and I fancy, from appearances, they were then purifying
their own garments.</p>

<p class="p2">To what extent theatres are open, I have no means of
stating. I believe that in Paris and other large French
towns, if not elsewhere, the theatres are in full operation.</p>

<p class="p2">In places where musical bands play, as at Interlachen,
the music proceeds just as on ordinary days&mdash;once, twice,
or three times a day, according to the custom of the place;
but it gathers to it all the idlers, and is therefore generally
listened to by far greater crowds than during the week.
Nor is the music different in character from what is usually
performed. There is no attempt to compromise matters
by playing sacred tunes. Not improbably, in some places,
there may be a better selection of secular music than
usual; ‘classical music’ may be attempted. At Cannes,
although it is a thoroughly English settlement, the band
plays on Sunday near the Mairie. At Mentone the playing
took place outside the <i>cirque</i>, near to some of the churches,
so that the worshippers had to pass by it to reach them.</p>

<p class="p2">Where there are Galleries or Museums, Sunday is usually
an open or free day, no payment being exacted. At
Naples the Museum, and at Florence the Picture Galleries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and the grounds of the Royal Pitti Palace, are open to
the public, the only other day in the week on which
the Museum and Galleries are free being Thursdays. Ascension
Day, however, seems to be regarded as more holy
than Sunday, for it happened at Florence, while we were
there, and falling upon a Thursday, the Galleries were
closed. The Louvre in Paris is open on Sunday, but is
closed on Monday, to be cleaned. The Capitoline Museum
in Rome (belonging to Government) is open on Sundays
gratis, but as a rule galleries as well as shops are closed on
Sundays in Rome.</p>

<p class="p2">The Casino at Monte Carlo is always open on Sundays,
and was a source of attraction to many of the foreign visitors
at Mentone, and sometimes, though more rarely, even to such
English people as were not very strict in their views.</p>

<p class="p2">The Carnival proceeded at Nice the same as on the
other day or days on which it was held. It was probably
then a grander affair, and I believe drew to it much greater
crowds&mdash;many, though not many English, going to see
it from Mentone, and, no doubt, from all the surrounding
parts.</p>

<p class="p2">Sunday, indeed, is regarded as a fete day. In the times
of the Empire I found it, on occasion of my first visit to
Paris, to be the day of the great Fête Napoleon. It
was also the day for illuminations, and for playing the
Grandes-Eaux at Versailles. The same practice prevails
elsewhere. At Rome there was on one Sunday during
our visit an illumination of the Piazza del Popolo, and
a balloon was sent up in the course of the evening. At
Pau also our attention was called one Sunday afternoon
to an immense balloon descending, with a man suspended
from it by ropes&mdash;a most perilous-looking adventure, and
by no means an agreeable spectacle, though we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not near enough to see the man distinctly. Throughout
France the elections take place on the Sunday, and possibly
it is the same elsewhere. In Italy and in Paris, as well as
in other places, people expend a portion of their earnings
in driving about in cabs and other vehicles plying for hire.
One summer, a few years ago, we spent a fortnight in the
Champs Elysées, and found that on Sunday evening they
were, if possible, more brilliantly lighted up, and more gay
and noisy, than on other nights; but I think the great
spectacle then to be seen was derived from the multiplicity
of <i>voitures</i> driving up and down, two rows one way and
two rows another, in continuous line. As each carries
either one or two lights (I am not sure which, but I think
two), and as nothing at a little distance but the lights is
seen, the effect is curious. The broad roadway seems from
the Place de la Concorde to the Triumphal Arch to be filled
with an incessant stream of Will-o’-the-wisp-like lights
noiselessly flitting up and down the course.</p>

<p class="p2">Letters are delivered by the post either as usual on the
rest of the week, or at all events on the Sunday morning,
but my impression is that there is no difference in the
deliveries. When there were any letters to annoy us, they
were sure to come on a Sunday morning, so that often we
wished there had been no delivery.</p>

<p class="p2">In hotels at home, with a laudable view to lessen the
work of servants and give opportunity to them to go
to church, visitors who have private rooms are often requested
to dine on Sundays at the public table, and I have
heard of no less than thirteen newly-married couples at
one of the English lake hotels having thus one Sunday
complied. As people abroad are little in the habit of
dining in private rooms, there is not scope for this observance.
But Sunday is always regarded as a day for a
somewhat better dinner than usual. Sometimes, if not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the ordinary programme, it is in the shape of a course of
ices, or it may be some other rarity.</p>

<p class="p2">The employment of the evening depends upon the company.
The English, as a rule, observe Sunday abroad much
as they do at home, except, of course, that being in a hotel,
they are thrown more into living in public. Many retire
to their rooms and read. But often before they do so, in
hotels frequented by them,&mdash;particularly if exclusively so,&mdash;the
young people, led by some one at the piano, will
join in singing hymns. Even in hotels where foreigners
are the principal visitors, English people present will sometimes
strike up a hymn. This takes place usually to
the apparent enjoyment of the foreigners, who seem not to
know what to do with themselves on Sunday. They do
not read, at least to the extent to which the English do.
It is not unusual for them to have recourse to cards, or
drafts, or chess, while their children romp about in a way
at which we should be scandalized at home. Occasionally
a visitor will play and sing at the piano secular tunes and
songs, though when our countrywomen go to the piano they
rarely select anything but sacred pieces.</p>

<p class="p2">One Sunday evening I recollect its being announced
that there would be a concert by professional musicians in
the <i>salon</i>, from which, before the concert began, nearly
all the English quietly withdrew. It was not repeated in
the same house while we were there.</p>

<p class="p2">In travelling, those who desire to have a book for
Sunday reading, ought to take one or more such books with
them. They are not procurable in shops or in circulating
libraries. Possibly they may be, though probably not of a
high class, at Tract Dépôts; but where these depots are to
be found, may not always be easy to learn. However, in
season places the churches have generally small libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
attached to them, which are useful to those who are there for
the season. A passing traveller of course cannot avail himself
of them. It is not a bad plan to have the monthly
magazines sent by book post to one’s foreign address, and
when read they may prove very acceptable gifts to others.</p>

<p class="p2">It was not often that we were induced by curiosity to go
into a Roman Catholic Church on a Sunday. The proceedings
are unintelligible to the uninitiated, and the
service seems to be all performed for the people by the
priests, who are ‘the Church.’ Where there is singing or
vocal music, it is done by the priests alone, aided by boys,
and sometimes, though very rarely, by women. I recollect,
when in Antwerp many years ago, on occasion of some
great festival the choir was augmented by a number of
(concealed) female singers with the sweetest voices. But
the congregation never joins in the singing. They listen, just
as congregations do at home to anthems performed by choirs,
which it would require a knowledge of music, acquaintance
with the piece, a music book, and a good voice to enable
them to take part in. The service is conducted by the priests,
with their backs to the people, these backs being generally
covered with an ornamented dress, sometimes exhibiting an
inserted cross in colours, sometimes white satin with rich
gold embroidery, but varying according to the rank held
by the priest, and according to the place, and doubtless
according, in some churches, to the importance of the day.
The chief priest appears to be reading a large book before
him on the altar, and mumbling something to himself; and
every now and then he and they (when more than one) perform
a genuflexion or change position, and sometimes he
turns round to the audience and says something inaudibly,
while a boy tinkles a bell as a signal to the people at certain
stages of the service. The ceremony is familiar to all who
have been abroad. This priest service is no doubt intended,
with other things, to exalt the priesthood and to swell its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
power, the grasp and severity of which the world has unfortunately
too often felt. It is only right, however, to say that
the people listen devoutly, and seem to know something at
least of what is going on, and can follow it and understand
when to rise up and when to kneel down. Many of them
hold in their hands the book containing the service, which
is printed both in Latin and in their own tongue; and were
this book (after which the Prayer Book of the Church of
England is modelled) purged of some erroneous matters,
such as the prayers to the Virgin Mary and Saints, it contains
a service to the words of which Protestants probably
could not object. Mass sometimes begins very early in the
morning; and after it has been said by the priest (I think
it does not take much longer than half an hour), the congregation
clears out and is succeeded by another, which
pours in, before whom the service is repeated. People who
have so heard mass apparently consider they have done
their duty for the day so far as church worship is concerned.</p>

<p class="p2">When a priest preaches, which seems to be only rarely,
and possibly only when he has the faculty, he mounts the
pulpit, by his side in which a large crucifix is stuck, and
addresses the people shortly but with great animation, his
eloquence increasing like the Welsh preachers as he proceeds,
till he reaches his climax in such a fervent heat that
the perspiration will burst from his brow. No doubt he
succeeds in stirring his auditors, but I never could make
out sufficiently what was said to know exactly the purport
of discourse. But the blessed Virgin is frequently invoked.</p>

<p class="p2">Roman Catholicism, however, must be losing ground
fast, as the people increase in knowledge and desire to be
free from clerical yoke; and it is astonishing to what an
extent Protestantism, everywhere tolerated now, prevails in
countries formerly so pope and priest ridden. A book,
called <i>A Guide to Evangelical Work on the Continent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Europe, and on the Southern and Eastern Shores of the
Mediterranean</i>, published by the Committee of the Foreign
Evangelical Society (London: James Nisbet &amp; Co., 21
Berners Street; Paris: 4 Place du Théâtre Français, Rue
de Rivoli), gives an idea of the extent of this work.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I
have tried to make up some statistics from it, but have not
found my results to agree in numbers with the prefatory
notes prefixed to some of the sections. I observe, however,
that in France the Reformed Church, under the control of
the State, is by far the largest of the Protestant denominations,
and it is stated in the guide to consist of 483
parishes and 573 pastors. But on reckoning up the
churches named in the book, it seems only to mention 124
Reformed Churches. Probably the explanation is that all
parishes are not given. Of the Church of the Augsburg
Confession, or Lutheran Church, there seem to be 63; of
the Methodists, 7; of the Société Evangélique de France,
25; of the Société Centrale, 70; of the Wesleyan Church,
39; of the Free Church, 63; Independents, 6; Baptists,
6; Société Evangélique de Genève, 14; Society of
Friends, 1; other denominations, 11 churches or stations.
In all these the service is in the native French, and intended
for the natives, and there is not a town of any
importance in which there is not one or more of the
different denominations represented by a church, so that it
will be seen that Protestantism must be spreading and
taking a deeper hold on the people. In Paris alone there
are, <i>inter alia</i>, the following French Protestant churches:&mdash;Reformed
Church, 19; Lutheran, 16; Evangélique de
France, 7; Baptist, 1; French Wesleyan, 6. The native
population, besides, throughout France, is reached by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
multitude of Protestant or Evangelical associations and
institutions and schools, such as Young Men’s Christian
Associations, mission homes, orphanages, etc., and there
are not less than 85 Bible or Tract Dépôts. I state all
these figures <i>salvo justo calculo</i>, and with the impression
that they only represent a portion of the work, and they are
at least short of the figures given in the prefatory ‘note’
on the Protestant Churches of France.</p>

<p class="p2">In some cases, as at Biarritz, French service is conducted
in the English Church; in others, as at Lucerne and
Chateau d’&OElig;x, the English service is held in the native
Protestant Church.</p>

<p class="p2">At Mentone, the French Protestant Church, under the
pastoral care of a most worthy man, M. Delapierre, is
largely attended by English-speaking people. Indeed, I would
say that English, Scotch, and Americans of all denominations
form during the season by far the principal part
of the congregation. We used almost regularly to attend
this church during one of the Sunday services, going to one
of the other churches for the other service. A layman
commenced by reading a short liturgy or formulary of
devotion, then a portion of Scripture, and, having given
out a hymn or canticle, as it is termed, left the pulpit,
and the minister taking his place, after extempore prayer,
preached a sermon. M. Delapierre spoke slowly and distinctly,
and it was easy, comparatively, to follow him. His
thoughts were always good and striking, though simple,
often rising to an elevated and earnest eloquence, calculated
to make a deep impression. He was much respected and
esteemed by all, but unfortunately was, or rather is, a man
of delicate health; so that he only took one of the Sunday
services, and had for a short time to leave Mentone
for relaxation and change of air. His assistants (young
men) we never could follow so well. Hymn-books, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the canticles set to music, were placed in all the pews;
and generally at the close of the service a doxology was
sung, being a verse commencing, ‘Gloire soit au Saint
Esprit,’ to the tune called Hursley, the old German melody
to which the hymn ‘Sun of my Soul’ has been wedded.
There is a striking and puzzling peculiarity in the French
singing, for the words are not sung as spoken. Thus
<i>père</i> is pronounced <i>peray</i>. The singing also is in slow
time. The Communion was dispensed on the first Sunday
of the month, all who desired being, without distinction
of sect, invited to attend, and was conducted very much in
the same way as in Congregational churches at home.</p>

<p class="p2">We once witnessed in this church the baptism of an
infant. The father and mother, nurse and baby, and
another man and woman&mdash;all stood up in front of the
reading-desk below the pulpit, to which M. Delapierre
descended, and took the baby, which had been squalling,
over his left arm. Holding up his hand, and looking down
upon it, its great eyes looked up into his either in terror or
in wonder, and all was still, not even the water sprinkling
disturbing its equanimity. The preliminary service or address
seemed to be somewhat long.</p>

<p>No gown or vestment of any kind was used in the
church beyond the wearing of black clothes and a white tie,
although I believe a gown is worn in many other French
churches. Everything was conducted with the reverent
simplicity so consistent with true worship. The singing
was assisted by a harmonium, amply sufficient for the size
of the church, which I suppose might not be seated for
many more than two hundred.</p>

<p class="p2">In Italy the Waldensian is the largest of the native
churches. The <i>Guide</i> (p. 159) says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Their missionaries are now found in all parts of Italy. There are 40
churches, some of them small, perhaps, but of living Christians; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
are also 10 missionary stations, with 30 ordained pastors and 20 lay preachers,
who visit every month 50 other small towns where there are those friendly to
the gospel. There are at present upwards of 2000 converts. This Church,
which has 15 parishes in the Waldensian valleys, has a College or Lyceum
at Torre Pellice, the capital, and a Theological College at Florence, with
three able professors.’</p>

<p class="p1">Next to the Waldensian is the Free Christian Church,
which ‘has taken a position between Presbyterianism and
Congregationalism. It has 37 stations and 24 preachers.’
After it the Wesleyan Church comes, with 28 stations and
as many Italian ministers. There are in Italy 14 Bible
or Tract Dépôts.</p>

<p class="p2">In Switzerland, Protestant service is conducted in most of
the towns by, <i>inter alia</i>, the National Reformed Church, the
Free Church, the Société Evangélique de Genève. There
are 16 Bible or Tract Dépôts throughout the country.</p>

<p class="p2">We attended a French service in the church at Chateau
d’&OElig;x, and found a peculiarity existing there which perhaps
may be characteristic of the native Swiss churches, for all
the women were seated on one side, and all the men on
the other, as, I believe, is the case with the Society of
Friends in Great Britain. Not till it was too late did I
discover I was a black sheep among the women. This
congregation sat at singing and rose at prayer. The church,
a tolerably large one, was quite full, and no doubt many
came from a considerable distance.</p>

<p class="p2">Having said so much with regard to the native churches,
I shall now state a few facts regarding those conducted
in English for the benefit of strangers.</p>

<p class="p2">There are of American churches in France, 3; in Italy,
3; in Switzerland, 1; of Wesleyan or Methodist, 5 in
France, 2 in Italy (not including American Methodist,
which are probably Italian churches), and none in Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Apparently there is but one Congregational church
in these three countries, viz. in Paris, where nearly all the
above churches stated to be in France likewise are. The
remaining English churches are either Scotch Presbyterian
or English Episcopalian.</p>

<p class="p2">Taking the Scotch Presbyterian first, I ascertain from
the <i>Guide</i> (by summation), in France 6, in Italy 6, in
Switzerland 5&mdash;17 churches altogether, but there may
possibly be other Scotch services not noted&mdash;as, for example,
we found a room occupied in Venice which is not a station
noted. Of these 17, I find from the <i>Guide</i> (comparing
it, too, with a card obtained abroad), there are 11 in connection
with the Free Church of Scotland; there is only one
in connection with the United Presbyterian body; the remaining
five are either in connection with the Established
Church of Scotland, or are, as in Rome, and as they undoubtedly
should be, ‘occupied by a minister of the Established,
Free, or United Presbyterian Church of Scotland.’
It would be much better if all the churches were in connection
with all these bodies; and, indeed, there is no
reason why they might not take in Independents and
Baptists and other denominations, and call it everywhere
the ‘Scotch Church.’ It would strengthen their hands
very much, and avoid, at least, the appearance of unnecessary
schism. I believe, however, there is an understanding, so
far commendable, that where one of the three Presbyterian
bodies above named already has a station in a foreign town,
neither of the others shall introduce one of their own.</p>

<p class="p2">In some places the Presbyterian Churches have a chapel
or building devoted to worship, as at Cannes. In others
a room is engaged, as at Mentone; and I may here mention
that the same thing is found with regard to the Episcopal
Churches or stations: frequently a room in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hotels is used, and sometimes, as at Sorrento, is devoted to
this use. Where a church has been built by an Episcopalian
body, a great deal of space seems often lost, as at Hyères,
in the chancel; and in such cases, when the minister retires
to its extreme end to read the communion service, his voice
is sometimes lost to the congregation.</p>

<p class="p2">In Florence, Leghorn, Pau, and perhaps elsewhere, there is
a permanent settled minister attached to the Presbyterian
Church. At other stations the pulpit is supplied either
by ministers sent out for the season, or more generally by
ministers requiring to go abroad for health, to whom the
chaplaincy is pecuniarily an advantage; but it can scarcely
be an advantage in regard of their own health, and it does
not tend to secure for the station the best men. However,
if this were not done, probably stations might become
vacant. At Rome, where there is a large nice church outside
the Porto del Popolo, alongside of other Protestant churches,
care is taken to send for a short period a man, or rather two
men, of recognised ability&mdash;a very proper step in such a
city, and one which, were it possible, it would be well to
take elsewhere. While we were in Rome, we were so
fortunate as to have, among others, Mr. Mitchell of Leith,
who spoke with great power and eloquence. It was
strange and gladdening to think that in the very citadel
of Old Giant Pope there was now such perfect freedom
of speech.</p>

<p class="p2">The English Episcopal Church is necessarily far more
largely represented abroad. In fact, there is no town of
any importance in which there is not a service conducted
according to the forms of this Church. In France, as
appearing from the <i>Guide</i>, there are 54 stations; in Italy,
23; in Switzerland, 43; in all, 120. Of course in other
countries it is similarly, though perhaps not so largely
represented, because the three above-named are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
principal countries frequented by English travellers, and
it is to them the present observations have had exclusive
reference.</p>

<p class="p2">I do not profess to know much about the operations of
the Episcopal Church of England, but I believe that it has
two societies in connection with the Continent&mdash;the Colonial
and Continental Society, and the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel. This last belongs to the High Church
or Ritualistic party.</p>

<p class="p2">Ritualism is not, according to my limited opportunities
of observing, very rampant abroad, although, looking at it
as a dangerous and insidious Jesuitical attempt to subvert
the Protestant Church of England to Rome, or to its errors,
and to swell the power of the clergy, the least beginnings
deserve to be carefully watched and reprobated by all who
desire to preserve the purity of Christian worship. Even
were it carried to the most extravagant lengths to which it
sometimes is in England, it would pale its ineffectual fire
before the full blaze of the Roman Catholic Churches
around in their richly-adorned cathedrals, their great altars
heaped with all manner of valuables and decorations, their
innumerable candles of all sizes, their multiplicity of priests
with gorgeous vestments, their full-voiced sonorous chanting,
their theatrical ceremonial.</p>

<p>But in some places there is a tendency, apparently held
under a certain check, towards Ritualistic practices.</p>

<p>Of course one sees everywhere in Episcopal congregations
a good deal of genuflexion among the women.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But
I imagine this is not regarded by many good people as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Ritualistic, although it has a considerable resemblance to
the observance in Roman Catholic churches of bending the
knee before every crucifix which is passed.</p>

<p>The church is open in some places every morning of the
week for reading of prayers.</p>

<p>Intoning the prayers is occasionally attempted; but in
a small church, and essayed by one whose voice is not
naturally musical, the unaccustomed performance assumes
all the appearance of a timidity conscious of deviation
from the simplicity of genuine worship.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the altar is gaily ornamented, and a
large cross is placed on it, and sometimes there is in a compartment
of the window over it a representation of the
Saviour on the cross in stained glass. At one little town
where we spent a Sunday, the minister was a young man
with Ritualistic tendencies. We attended the little chapel,
the congregation (one-half probably Episcopalians) being
about a dozen or fifteen persons, nearly filling it. The
altar was plain, just a table covered with a red cloth, but
a large cross stood on it. Shortly after having read the
commandment, ‘Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven
image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,
or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth;
thou shalt not bow down to them nor worship them,’ etc.,
the young man knelt down on his knees before the cross
with his back to the congregation, as if in silent adoration.
Upon this an English gentleman immediately rose up, and
with his family walked out, and I felt much inclined to
follow his example.</p>

<p>The single attempt at robing I have witnessed was in
the use of stoles, where the wearer, having a black one and
a red one, pleased himself by crossing them on his back
like a St. Andrew’s cross.</p>

<p>The only other practice I am aware of, savouring of
Ritualism, is where three or four stalwart young men, robed
in white, have marched in swinging procession from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
vestry up the aisle to the chancel to ‘perform’ the duty,
not requiring great physical and still less mental exertion,
of reading prayers, upon which (the watchful choir leading
by rising up) great part of the congregation stood to do
them reverence in the house of their Master. One almost
expected the men, horrified, to turn round and call out to
the people in the words of the angel, ‘See thou do it not,
for I am thy fellow-servant. Worship God.’</p>

<p class="p2">I believe, were it not that in all the Episcopalian congregations
abroad there is a large proportion who either do
not belong to the body, or belonging to it, thoroughly
disapprove of the practices of the Ritualists (spoken of by
the Roman Catholics as ‘our first cousins’), there might be
more latitude taken. But this reason should go a good
deal further and put an end to it altogether, because it has
a direct tendency to prevent those who cannot reconcile
their conscience to giving even the semblance of approval
by attending service, from coming to the chapel in which
they prevail, and which may be the only one in the
place.</p>

<p class="p2">All these and any further observations, though made
tenderly, must be taken as by one who does not belong to
the Episcopalian communion, and as indicating perhaps the
impressions formed by strangers or by those belonging to
other denominations.</p>

<p class="p2">The practice now so common, but I believe originally
not either intended or observed, of reading the Litany and
Communion Service in addition to the ordinary Morning
Service, is very general abroad, and, conveniently for lazy
or careless clergymen, shoves the sermon into a corner, so
that, losing importance, it becomes short and is commonplace,
being seldom striking or impressive, although this
orthodox flatness is occasionally transgressed, sometimes singularly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
We once heard a sermon on Saint Michael almost
leading up to the worship of angels, and at Mentone a
stranger one afternoon occupying the pulpit spoke in
eulogy of war at a time when war or peace were trembling
in the balance, and there was little need to inflame
some minds.</p>

<p class="p2">In the Episcopal churches there is usually a printed
notice in every pew to the effect that the income of the
chaplaincy is dependent on the offertory, and at every
service (even, I believe, on week-days) a collection is made
by sending up the collecting plate through every pew.
While this is done, the congregation, or the major part,
stands, although perhaps not one in a hundred could
assign any feasible reason for doing so, and the minister
for whose benefit the collection is made reads out at intervals
certain verses of Scripture. The collecting plates
with their contents are taken to him, and by him are
deposited on the altar, and afterwards carried by him to
the vestry. To say that this practice produces more, is only
to act on the Roman Catholic doctrine that the end justifies
the means. In other places, such as in Paris, the custom,
in better taste, is to hold out a plate at the door as the
congregation retires.</p>

<p>The hours of service on Sunday are generally at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
and 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> If the second service be taken in the evening,
it is not always so arranged as to avoid trenching on the
hotel dinner hour. In the Riviera it is invariably in the
afternoon, and it is kept short so as to allow invalids to get
home some time before sunset of the winter months. The
morning service is always well attended; but the afternoon
service (except in such places as Cannes and Mentone, and
even there, too, to a certain extent) is, in Episcopal churches,
deserted, and there is only a sprinkling of people in the
pews. I have at one place seen only a single person
besides ourselves and those officiating; at others, only a few,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and probably none of them belonging to the Episcopal
Church. In these cases, sometimes only the Evening Service
is read.</p>

<p class="p2">Out of Paris and Rome, there is hardly a ‘Dissenting’
Church represented; and as the worship of the other
churches does not fundamentally differ, it may be convenient,
in what I am about to say, to design and classify
them all as Presbyterian. Putting out of view such places
as Paris, Florence, and Rome, those attending the Presbyterian
services are comparatively few in number; and this
is partly attributable to the congregations being drawn from
a smaller community, and from a nation in which, among
the better classes, from whose ranks to a large extent
travellers are drawn, Episcopalianism is, to a considerable
extent, considered fashionable. Assuming the population
of England to be seven times that of Scotland, the seventeen
Scotch Church stations form just about the fair proportion
as compared with the 120 English Church stations; while
upon the same calculation, the numbers of those who should
attend Scotch services ought to be only one-seventh, or, say,
10 for every 70. In this view of it, the Scotch churches
are fairly enough represented. But, of course, this is not
a practical view, and it is obvious that there must be great
difficulty in maintaining, with so few supporters, stations in
not very populous towns.</p>

<p class="p2">In Fielding’s time, Thwackum’s definition of religion
might very well represent general opinion in England, at
least among Episcopalians. By religion, he said, ‘I mean
the Christian religion, and not only the Christian religion,
but the Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant
religion, but the Church of England.’ The idea dictating
this expression finds utterance more recently in Dean Hook
saying, with reference to an interview with Dr. Chalmers,
‘It would be contrary to my principles to hear him preach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>’
Many still would shrink from entering a Presbyterian or
Dissenting church, though they are themselves Dissenters
when across the Scottish border, where all sects are on the
same level, no sect affecting a religious superiority over
another, or being conscious of any social separation from
others. But when bishops have quietly gone to hear
popular Scotch ministers like Dr. Guthrie, and when men
like Dean Stanley have even conducted Presbyterian service
in Scotland, it shows that this narrow and unchristian
illiberality of feeling is passing away. Presbyterians and
Dissenters in general take a large and liberal view, and do
not hesitate to go, at least occasionally, to an English Episcopal
chapel; and where it is conducted with simplicity and
reverence, they even enjoy a casual attendance, and hearing
the fine old service of the English Church, although after
having had to go repeatedly they are glad to get back to the
less formal worship to which they have been accustomed.</p>

<p class="p2">Now, does not all this suggest for consideration whether
it would not be possible, in the smaller places at least, to
combine the Scotch and English services in such a way as
would enable all to meet in common. There are marked
peculiarities in both, distinguishing them, no doubt&mdash;peculiarities
which at home will take long, by mutual reconcilement,
to efface; but when people are from home, there is a
tendency to meet more on common ground and feel members
of the same great community. Thus it is not uncommon,
at least in Scotland, in large hydropathic establishments,
very much to the satisfaction of all, to have the whole
company assembled on a Sunday evening for a simple
worship by reading of Scripture, singing of hymns, extempore
prayer, and a sermon or address by a Presbyterian
minister.</p>

<p class="p2">Apart from the objection which Presbyterians have to
a service which is wholly read, and is therefore apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
degenerate into ceremonious worship, there is not a great
deal in what is usually read to which they would take
exception. The absolution would be better out, as having
a tendency to mislead,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and it grates upon unaccustomed
ears to hear the words of the prosaic version of the Psalms
contained in the Prayer Book substituted for the far grander
and more poetical words of the Authorized Version. But
the Prayer Book, till reformed or revised, would need to
be taken as it stands. There would be, however, no need
for adding to the morning or evening service the communion
service&mdash;that might be reserved for those who desired
to remain one Sunday in the month for the Episcopal
communion, the Presbyterians taking another Sunday in
the month for their communion. Nor need the Litany be
always used. Then, with regard to the remainder of the
service, why not have a Presbyterian minister, when he
could be got (and sometimes there are even men of eminence
going about), to take it alternately, or otherwise, with the
Episcopalian, by giving a short suitable extempore prayer
before sermon, and then preaching a sermon according to his
own usage&mdash;in other words, adopting the mode of service
practised in the Rev. Newman Hall’s church, London.</p>

<p class="p2">Besides other and higher good, this alternate preaching
might benefit even the ministers themselves of both communions.
The great fault among Episcopalian clergymen
is that, in the generality of cases, what they read has no
pretence or aim at preaching, but consists rather of a string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of meagre platitudes, of sentiments which nobody would
controvert, a dry homily read without feeling or animation,
and having no intention of reaching the soul or heart of the
hearers. The ministers of the other communions have, as
a rule, a higher estimate of the duty of the preacher; but
they do not always have the power or the perception of
the means of carrying it out successfully. Among men of
mediocrity, the idea seems to be to occupy a long statutory
three-quarters of an hour in a stiff, formal, methodical fashion
of dividing and exhausting the subject, and an equally
formal and unskilful, and therefore ineffective, application
and address. While added to ignorance of the arts of
arresting and maintaining attention and of persuading an
audience, Presbyterian divines too often do not choose the
most suitable subjects of discourse. Might not even the
spirit of emulation evoke better things?</p>

<p class="p2">It is too much the custom in churches in Scotland, after
sermon, to close with a hymn, a prayer, and an anthem.
After an impressive sermon, it seems only calculated to
drive out the impression to have, immediately after, the
same subject and the same thoughts droned out by the
congregation in a melancholy paraphrase to a doleful tune,
followed up by the blare and fanfare of an elaborate high-sounding
anthem performed by the choir according to book.
The English method, where all this would be more appropriate,
is to close quietly. But sometimes the minister stops
suddenly short, and with startling rapidity utters, ‘Now
to God the Father,’ etc. However, the rule is, whether
with or without this invocation, to close with either benediction,
or a short prayer and benediction. We did not
often go to the west church at Mentone, though near to us,
because the flavour of the service inclined to be ‘high’;
but the closing there was always pleasing. After the
minister had pronounced the benediction, and before the
congregation rose from their knees, the choir (composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
principally of young ladies with good and trained voices),
to the accompaniment of the organ, in subdued tones, so
suitable to parting with reverent step and slow, sung to a
soft sweet tune the following simple, perhaps child-like
verse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pps6 p1">‘Lord, keep us safe this night,</p>
<p class="ppi6">Secure from all we fear;<br />
May angels guard us while we sleep,</p>
<p class="ppi6">Till morning light appear.’</p>

<h2 class="p2">VI.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>LONDON TO SOUTH OF FRANCE.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Selecting</span> the route to Paris by Folkestone, we left London
on the afternoon of 1st November 1876, and slept at
Folkestone. The steamboat was to sail the following
morning at 9.15, and to have proceeded direct would have
involved leaving London at the inconveniently early hour
of 7.10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The train by Dover and Calais departs fixedly
at 7.40 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, so that one is not much better off by taking
that route. But on proceeding by Boulogne, there is a
chance that the state of the tide may throw the time of
sailing to a later hour; only when this is the case, it
involves arriving at the journey’s end late in the evening.
The train in connection with the boat by which we were
to sail, was due in Paris at 4.40 afternoon&mdash;a nice time at
which to arrive.</p>

<p class="p2">One does not get a chance of observing whether there be
any attractions about Folkestone by just sleeping a night
there. It may be a very Paradise upon earth; and, from
its facilities for popping over to France, to its residents it
probably is. One cannot say, but it does not look like it.
Possibly the quarter to which summer visitors resort may
be more inviting than the portion disclosed at the harbour.
Anyhow, it seems a less dreary, out-of-the-world place than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Newhaven. But Britannia rebels a little at her children
quitting their native land to get enamoured with strange
countries, and frowns upon their departure; for these nights
before crossing are by no means pleasurable. One is
brought into rather close proximity to the dreaded passage;
and if the wind should howl or be even but moderately
fresh, or if the sea, unwitting of its gigantean power, be
only sporting in joyous freedom, the prospect for the morrow
is far from assuring. Then it is a busy, bustling, uncomfortable
scene at the hotel. Piles of luggage strew the
hall. Apprehensive passengers are arriving by successive
trains, and others in a woe-begone condition, and in all sorts
and manners of wraps and disguises, by the boats. They
are dining, teaing, suppering in a confused disagreeable way
in the coffee-room. Anxious waiters and active chamber-maids
are hurrying about. Porters meet you in narrow
corners laden with luggage. There is nothing to invite you
to remain in the public room. There is nothing to induce
you to venture long out of doors. People depart early to
bed. But the search for petty utilities by the feeble light
of candle, the cramped bedroom, the cheerless difference
from home, produce a feeling of discomfort which, combined
with the early retirement, the noise and tramping about
the corridors, the creaking of ships’ gearing dimly heard,
and the thoughts arising,&mdash;which have little in them of
the land of promise and more of the morn,&mdash;all keep the
pilgrim long restless upon bed; and, after an unrefreshing
night of broken sleep, he is glad to get up betimes for an
early breakfast, call, with twenty others simultaneously, for
the bill, settle it up quick if correct, and, after an impatient
waiting for his goods, which seem never likely to make their
appearance, and seeing that every little thing is brought
along, to be off to the steamboat; for nobody stays, unless
in exceptional circumstances, such as pending a storm, more
than a night. After a little, the train arrives, and an endless
procession of unassorted passengers moves slowly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
board; the luggage and merchandise brought by it tediously
follow. At last the gangway is dragged ashore, the vessel
is released, and, after the usual backings and easings and
tender movements, it tardily steams out of harbour, increases
its speed, and we sit looking on the land, the return to
which may be in the far future; and, thinking much of
dear friends from whom we have parted, we gradually, as
the distance widens, lose sight of Old England, and passing
here and there a gallant ship, with its snowy sails catching,
fortunately for us, but a gentle balmy breeze, we near the
other&mdash;once hostile, now friendly&mdash;shore, and landing find
ourselves among a foreign race, and gazing upon foreign
habitations, and soon encountering foreign customs and
institutions.</p>

<p class="p2">We made the mistake of registering our luggage at
London when we left London, instead of taking it on with
us to Folkestone and registering it there for Paris. The
consequence was that, on arrival of the train at Paris, we
were compelled to wait nearly an hour at the station, which
was cold, dark, and drafty, until all the luggage which had
come by the train by which we had arrived had been arranged,
examined by the <i>douaniers</i>, and delivered to their
owners. We disconsolately saw our luggage standing
within a barred enclosure, but the men would on no account
touch it till then, and no doubt where thieves abound some
precaution of this kind is needful.</p>

<p>We had repeatedly visited Paris before, but in one
respect it was new to us&mdash;to see it in its wintry aspect.
On former occasions, we had visited it in the sunshine of
summer. But how changed did it look now! The trees
were yellow with the tints of autumn, and were nearly
stripped of their foliage. The air was cold and frosty, and
Paris looked bleak and miserable. We spent one or two
days in it; and one of the places to which we paid a visit
was beyond the range of ordinary sight-seeing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
daughters of some Edinburgh friends were at a large
boarding-school in Paris, in the Faubourg d’Auteuil. We
drove there to see them, and after some search discovered
the establishment, the name of which, ‘Une Institution des
Demoiselles,’ was painted up in letters a yard high. It
had quite a conventual aspect. The house was entered
through a narrow little door, hinged on a panel of a large
one (just like what one sees in the large door of a prison),
which, upon ringing the bell, was opened by a pull from
the opposite side of the court-yard, around which the
buildings of the school were placed. Crossing to the
dwelling-house, we were shown into a parlour, where our
young friends shortly came to us. They were all habited
in black, with a red leather belt, being the uniform compulsory
on all the pupils while in school. They informed
us there were 150 boarders, of whom only 17 were English.
Having introduced us to one of the governesses, this lady
very kindly showed us all over the place. Ranges of large
rooms were occupied as bedrooms, containing a separate bed
for each of the young ladies&mdash;all kept in the highest order,
and in white, spotless purity. Separate adjoining rooms
were fitted up as lavatories. Other rooms were schoolrooms;
others, dining-rooms, or <i>salles à manger</i>, where the young
people were then at lunch or early dinner, and evidently
enjoying a hearty meal. A separate building was kept as
an infirmary for the sick&mdash;a very prudent arrangement,
where so many young persons were brought together. For
those who were in good health, there was a large garden
and playground attached to the house.</p>

<p class="p2">On Monday, 6th November, having taken Gaze’s tickets
from London to Nice, we left Paris by the Lyons Railway,
registering our heavy luggage for Cannes; and we were free
to travel to any station on the line to Cannes, at which our
tickets permitted us to stop, only taking with us what we
would require for a week by the way. Some people prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
making the journey from Paris to Cannes, Nice, or Mentone
without break, and say there is less fatigue in doing so;
but it is a long journey, occupying from Paris to Mentone&mdash;journeying
by the express leaving at 11.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;twenty-eight
hours, arriving at Mentone at 3.24 next day. For
invalids in a feeble condition, it is in some respects preferable.
It is only one fatigue to be overcome, and it avoids
the risk of exposure to damp or rain. In cold, winter
weather at Paris, the one journey is certainly preferable,
and at the end of it people arrive in what is by contrast a
genial summer. So proceeding, passengers have, besides
other shorter stoppages, an interval of half an hour at Dijon,
at 5.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, to dine; 25 minutes at Lyons, at 10.18 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>;
and the following morning, at 6.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, 1 hour 25 minutes
at Marseilles to wash and breakfast.</p>

<p class="p2">We desired to take the journey leisurely, and to see a
little by the way. After the usual difficulty on French railways
of getting accommodation in the train, we proceeded
as far as Dijon. There is little to interest one by the route.
Fontainebleau, at which the express trains do not stop, is
passed soon after leaving Paris, but is nearly two miles
from the station. Its palace with its gardens is really the
only thing worth seeing, but to see them involves spending a
day at the town. If not pushed for time, they are, however,
well worthy of a visit. We stopped a night on our way
home to see them. The palace is extensive, consisting of four
distinct but united chateaux, erected at different times, with
splendid suites of rooms full of historical interest. The
forest, which covers 25,000 acres, is disappointing. The
charges at the hotel to which we went, were as high as those
of any in Paris.</p>

<p class="p2">We rested the first night at Dijon, a convenient halting-place.
The Hotel du Jura is near to the railway station,
and is most comfortable. The landlord of it is attentive, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
his charges moderate. Dijon was the former residence of
the Dukes of Burgundy, and is a curious old place, well
worthy of a visit for a day or two days. People often
break their journey at Dijon merely to sleep there, but,
arriving at night and departing next morning, do not always
visit the town. A forenoon may be very profitably spent
in walking about its promenades and its streets, with houses
adorned by quaint carvings and architecture, and seeing its
large, massively-built churches, particularly St. Michael
and St. Benigne, and its interesting old public buildings.
On the card of the hotel there is a little plan of the town,
in which the Place Grande is shown about its centre. Here
there is a large edifice which was formerly the palace
of the Dukes of Burgundy, now the Hotel de Ville, one
part of which has been converted into a museum and
picture gallery, the most interesting portion being the old
banqueting hall of the dukes, with its colossal chimney-piece
and its monuments, carrying one away back to the times of
boisterous mirth and probably lawless deeds.</p>

<p>Dijon stands high, and the weather being cold on our
journey south, we were glad of fires. We considered we
had made a mistake in travelling so late in the season.
Had we started about the middle of October, it would have
been better. The fact is, the larger part of the people
going for health to the Riviera make the grievous mistake
of delaying their departure till winter has commenced.
Many, indeed, do not come to the Riviera till the month
of January, in order to enjoy the gratification&mdash;dearly purchased,
in some cases&mdash;of a Christmas at home. By doing
so, they are obliged to travel through France during a
season when the weather is often piercingly chill, while
they are exposed in crossing the Channel to the risk of
encountering winter storms.</p>

<p class="p2">We proceeded next day to Lyons, passing through a rich
wine country, in the midst of which Macon lies, where, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the station, on high days and holidays, the women may be
seen wearing a witch-like hat of peculiar build. The cycle
of fashion will no doubt in due course make the whole
world acquainted with it, till which time the world may
wait and wonder. It may require some fortitude to don
this sweet marvel of a bonnet for the first time. But what
observation will not the ladies brave to follow their leader
in fashion!</p>

<p class="p2">At Lyons it was keenly cold. There is not much to be
seen at the ancient city, situated on the banks of the Rhone
and Saone, which effect their junction just below it. The
railway journey from Dijon occupies five or six hours,
according to the trains. We arrived in the dark, and drove
to the Hotel Collet, one of the best in the place. It is
situated in the main street, which may be said to be the
only good street of shops, formerly called the Rue Napoleon,
and now since the Republic, which changes even the names
of streets, the Rue Nationale. On entering the large hall,
round which were distributed palm trees and other tropical
plants in tubs and pots, we had the first suggestion of
approaching a southern clime.</p>

<p>Lyons is populous without being lively, and stately
without being imposing. We took a close carriage next
morning, and drove about for nearly four hours to see
what could be seen&mdash;almost the whole of which time
was occupied in visiting the junction of the rivers and
ascending Fourvières, a steep hill on the right bank of
the Saone, from which an extensive panoramic view is
in clear weather obtained, and Mont Blanc, about 130
miles distant, is sometimes seen&mdash;its visibility being a
circumstance symptomatic of approaching wet weather, as
we found did happen on a subsequent occasion, when the
white mountain was seen as we were nearing Lyons from
Geneva. Lyons at this season was looking very dreary,
and the cold necessitated our burning fires in the bedrooms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
On a former visit, in summer, the heat had been
almost unendurable. In the evening of the second day,
we found the large central hall of the hotel&mdash;which was
lighted from the roof, and afforded access by encircling
corridors and concealed stairs to the different floors&mdash;was
covered in by an awning, and the <i>salle à manger</i> was laid
for a magnificent dinner. It turned out that the principal
rooms were engaged for a wedding party (<i>noces</i>), the ordinary
guests being conducted to other rooms. It was, however, a very
quiet, solemn-looking affair; although the number assembled
was large, they made no noisy demonstrations. At breakfast-time
next morning the waiters seemed but half aroused.</p>

<p class="p2">We left Lyons by train at 11 o’clock forenoon. Our
through tickets required to be <i>vise’d</i> at the booking-office
before they would admit us to the <i>salle-d’attente</i>. The
route from Lyons southward is very interesting. The railway
skirts the Rhone nearly the whole way. The river
has been said to vary in width from a quarter of a mile to
two miles, although from the railway it does not appear
to be so wide. In the sunshine everything looked
beautiful. The farther south we got, the foliage became
fresher, and it was very charming to see the river rolling
softly on, fringed by trees, and through valleys, from which
rise the vine-clad hills. We passed the Côtes d’Or,
and other regions, where the famous Burgundy wines are
grown. Some of the mountain ranges are lofty. We
thought how much more beautiful would the river appear
during summer months, and our wish as regards time
was actually fulfilled the following September; but, alas! it
was then obscured by clouds and rain.</p>

<p class="p2">The railway to Marseilles passes several interesting
places, and among others, the towns of Orange, Avignon,
and Arles, which all contain relics of Roman occupation.
On occasion of our going south in September 1877, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
stopped at Avignon, which is 230 kilometres, or about 140
miles, from Lyons,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the train taking about six hours. When
one can manage it, Avignon is a place well worth stopping to
see. Leaving the station, we drove through some narrow dirty
streets till we reached the Hotel de l’Europe, the situation
of which is not at first inviting; but it is considered the
best hotel, and our rooms were very comfortable. It was
kept by a young landlady, who spoke English, and was
very attentive. On the following morning we took a cab
to drive about and see the town, and, <i>inter alia</i>, saw the
Calvi Museum, which contains many paintings, some
of which are good, and a large collection of coins and
books. Then we went to the cathedral, which is well
worth a visit. Here are the tombs of several popes. The
construction of the gallery of the church is peculiar. I
desired to have a photograph of the interior at a shop, but
they had it not. Photographs, however, were sold outside
the cathedral, and possibly I might have procured it
there; but we had so often found photographs sold at
the show places themselves so dear, that I had not asked
for them at the cathedral door. It does, however, sometimes
happen, as probably it did here, that they can only
be had at the place itself; and when time is limited, it is
better to secure what may be wanted, especially interiors,
at once. The pope’s old palace adjoins the cathedral.
This is a large building with very massive walls 100 feet
high. It is now occupied as a caserne or barrack for
French soldiers. The lofty rooms, for greater accommodation,
have had a floor interposed. The rooms, fitted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with beds and filled with the soldiery, are in a very
different condition from what they must at one time have
been when this was the papal residence. One of the
rooms into which we were shown, was the upper interposed
half of what had formerly been the chamber of torture of
the Inquisition. There was nothing very special now to
be seen in this dismal unoccupied apartment, which at one
time echoed with the groans and cries of the tortured.</p>

<p>In the Place de l’Hotel de Ville, in the centre of the
town, are a handsome-looking theatre and other public
buildings; but one of the most interesting objects in
Avignon is the old Roman bridge across the river.
Avignon was a fortified city, and is still surrounded by
walls having many gates, and in our drive we passed outside
the walls till we reached the Roman bridge. Only
part of it is now standing, the remainder having, I presume,
been swept away by floods. The river is now crossed by a
good modern bridge, not far from the site of the old one,
and conducts to a town upon the other bank of the river
which forms a suburb to Avignon.</p>

<p class="p2">We did not, in November 1876, stop at Avignon; but
being then desirous of seeing the old Roman city of
Nismes, we procured through the guard, when stopping at
the station of Valence, supplementary tickets enabling us to
change at Tarascon, which we reached in the dusk about
five o’clock. Here we had to change carriages, and cross
the platform, and enter a dingy station or <i>salle-d’attente</i>,
and to wait wearily for nearly an hour till the train
proceeded to Nismes. It was cold, and we had, as usual,
no assistance from porters with our <i>petits bagages</i>. Nismes
is about an hour’s journey by rail from Tarascon. The
mistral was blowing, and it was bitterly cold. The coldness
of this wind is, I believe, greatly produced by the cutting down
of the trees on the mountains in the south of France; and if
so, the sooner they are replanted the better. It is piercingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
felt all over the south of France, even Mentone, at its
extreme east point, not being wholly sheltered from its
influence. I fancy that in the Roman times, when such
places as Nismes, Avignon, and Arles were selected for
habitation, the mistral was not felt, at least to the extent
it is now. It prevented our invalid from leaving the house
while at Nismes on this occasion.</p>

<p class="p2">Nismes, as a capital city of a department of France, is a
town of importance. It is the seat of the departmental
courts, and it possesses various educational establishments
as well as a variety of manufactures. It is beautifully
situated in a fertile district. The town itself is attractive.
The principal streets are wide and clean, and the Boulevards
are pleasant; but it is as an ancient city, full of vestiges of
old Roman occupation, that it possesses charms to attract
the stranger.</p>

<p>The most famous of these Roman remains is the Arena,
and attention is naturally drawn to it from being situated
fronting a large open space in the heart of the town, called
the Esplanade. It was the first of the Roman amphitheatres
we had at that time seen. Exposed to the mistral, it was
then intensely cold; and one could hardly suppose that it
would have been built on that site if it had not been at
the time a place to which the people could go without fear
of colds (for, odd though it may sound, I fancy the grand old
Roman nose did suffer occasionally from colds). However,
an arena seems to have been then as necessary an appendage
to a Roman town as a church is to an English village.
The building is oval in shape, and is 412 feet long by 306
feet in breadth, and rises in upwards of 30 massive tiers
from the centre to the circumference, resting on strong
stone arches, and containing perfect means of ingress and
egress&mdash;every separate external arch having been, no doubt,
a separate vomitory. The building is computed to have
accommodated 32,000 persons. The arena, though in part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ruinous, is still in a very fair state of preservation, but is
undergoing a process of restoration by the insertion of new
stones in place of the old ones, to strengthen the structure,
which, as the old stone is grey with age and the new
stone is a beautiful pearly white, looks most incongruous.
One could almost wish that the building were let alone,
although it is to be hoped that in the course of years the
new stone will assume a colour in keeping with the rest.
Perhaps it might be stained to bring it into harmony. Of
this same kind of stone, two beautiful churches have recently
been built: one of them, St. Perpetué, is completed and in
use; the other, a very large one,&mdash;I presume to be occupied as
a cathedral, with a double spire far in advance when we saw
it first,&mdash;was in the following year not yet finished. The
designs of these churches, particularly in their spires, are
remarkably graceful. There is another very elegant modern
building adjoining the Arena, the Courts of Justice, which
also fronts the Esplanade, in the centre of which open space
has been erected a very handsome modern marble fountain
at a cost of £10,000.</p>

<p>Leaving the Arena and passing up the Boulevard St.
Antoine, we arrive at the <i>Maison Carrée</i>, or the Square House&mdash;a
small but beautiful temple, with a peristyle of the Corinthian
order, in admirable preservation. It is situated in
a space enclosed by railings, and is occupied as a museum
and picture gallery, for which it affords but limited room.
From the Maison Carrée the visitor proceeds through public
gardens to the Roman Baths, which are in wonderful condition,
although the marble statues have nearly all lost
their noses, the common fate of all marble statues long
exposed to the weather. These baths are very elegant
enclosures of water, now looking very stagnant and green.
Upon the west side are the ruins of what has been termed
a temple of Diana, in which are preserved many of the
antiquities found in the vicinity of it. To the south issues,
through an elegant iron rail and gateway, a very long wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
avenue or boulevard called <i>Cours Neuf</i>, on a straight line,
flanked by trees which, when completed, will extend, I
think, a full mile in length. The north extremity is
terminated by a hill, reached by magnificent stairs, and
commanding a fine view of the Baths or fountains, of the
long wide avenue beyond and the surrounding country.
This hill is surmounted by the <i>Tour Magne</i>, the ruin of
a building the object of which has not been definitely
ascertained.</p>

<p>Nismes in summer in fine weather is very hot, but is a
charming residence for a few days. We stayed two nights
on this occasion at the Hotel Luxembourg, which is recommended
to English travellers. The men-servants here, who
are also the <i>femmes-de-chambres</i>, had quite an Italian look
and cut, and were in their morning attire very comically
dressed in a short jacket, somewhat like those schoolboys
used to wear.</p>

<p class="p2">We returned <i>en route</i> for Marseilles by Tarascon, passing
by the way several stone quarries and fields in which olive
trees had been planted by way of experiment. These were
the first olive trees we had seen. They were young and
short, and were disappointing, as in fact are all olive trees,
however large or old they be, to those who, like ourselves,
having read of sitting under the olive tree as a species of
luxurious enjoyment, found them very different from our
expectations, being in leaf like the willow. But their
existence indicated approach to a warmer climate.</p>

<p class="p2">The old Roman town of Arles lies between Tarascon
and Marseilles, and is said to be, though I doubt it, as
much worth seeing as Nismes; but, owing to the difficulty
of finding trains to fit in to meet our time, we have not in
passing visited it.</p>

<p class="p2">It rained heavily all the way from Tarascon to Marseilles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
when it fortunately cleared up. Part of the way is flanked
by what appears to be barren desert land, possibly occasioned
by the ground being high and level, so that it is not
watered by rivers.</p>

<p class="p2">At Marseilles, we found the <i>commissionaire</i> of the Hotel
du Louvre et de la Paix, to which we had written for rooms,
waiting. Owing to some odd arrangement then prevailing,
all carriages were kept out of sight till the luggage was
sorted, so that we were fortunate to get him to send for one.
The hotel we found to be a large many-storeyed one, but it
had a lift. There is another large hotel at Marseilles, to
which we went on the next occasion. It is hard to say
which is the better. The Noailles has a large and beautiful
<i>salle à manger</i>, and a good-sized drawing-room. Both are
expensive. We found at Marseilles, as at Dijon, Lyons,
Avignon, Nismes, and afterwards at Hyères, that the charge
for <i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner included <i>vin ordinaire</i>. We had an
agreeable surprise at dinner in meeting two families&mdash;old
friends&mdash;from Bristol.</p>

<p class="p2">Marseilles is seldom visited, except as a place of halt for
further travel. After staying one or two nights, those
arriving depart either landward by railway or seaward by
steamboat to other parts. But it is well worth at least one
day’s visit to see it thoroughly. It is a very ancient city,
being upwards of 2500 years old, and the population is
above 300,000. In contrast to Lyons, it has all the
appearance of a busy place. The principal streets are
always crowded, the port is the largest in the Mediterranean,
and may be considered the Liverpool of France, though the
docks are not so extensive. On occasion of our first visit,
the weather was cold and wet, and we had only a Sunday
there, so that we did not see much; but when we paid it
a second visit in October 1877, we had a little more time,
and drove round the town and docks. The ancient port is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
a large natural harbour filled with good-sized vessels, while
additional docks of large extent stretch away to the westward.
Outside them, a breakwater has been built, which
extends about two miles in length. Bædeker says that, on
an average, nearly 20,000 vessels, of an aggregate burden of
2,000,000 tons, enter and quit Marseilles annually. Our
driver pointed out as we passed, in one of the docks (the
Basin de la Joillette), a P. &amp; O. steamer; and it would
have been interesting to have visited it, but we were
afraid we should not have had time. A large cathedral
was being built facing the docks, and will be a very prominent
object to those arriving at Marseilles by sea.
Another very prominent and striking object, and from which
a fine view of the town, harbour, and district is to be had,
is an eminence to the south-east, crowned by the Church of
Notre Dame de la Garde. Leaving the docks, we proceeded
round the town to the Palais de Longchamps, which stands
on a height. It is a large, elegant columnar structure, with
spacious staircases leading up to and through it to the
gardens beyond. The palace contains two museums. A fine
view is obtained from the top.</p>

<p>Marseilles is a busy commercial and manufacturing place.
The central streets are always bustling&mdash;teeming with life.
An interesting part of it is the flower market, where the
women are to be seen perched up on tables or platforms
tying up their pretty bouquets of flowers and selling them to
purchasers. The heights to the north of the town are bare,
but, together with the islands which stud the sea outside
the harbour, give picturesqueness to the view. But although
it stands as far south as Mentone and San Remo, or rather
farther south, it wants the shelter of the health resorts on
the Riviera, and suffers severely from exposure to the
mistral.</p>

<p class="p2">On leaving Marseilles for Cannes, we had not gone far
by railway before we obtained a complete change of temperature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
It was like passing from winter into summer,
and from dreary stony mountain ranges to verdant slopes
covered with mature olive trees, and with orange and lemon
trees&mdash;all indicative of a warmer climate. We did not on
this first occasion stop at any place between Marseilles and
Cannes, but on the following year visited Hyères, and it will
therefore be adverted to in the sequel.</p>

<p class="p2">On this first occasion, we left by an early train on the
Monday morning with our friends. We had much difficulty
in getting seat-room, with no assistance from guards. The
carriages were filled with people who had travelled all night
from Paris. In the compartment which fell to our lot, the
remainder of the seats were all filled by French gentlemen
who were or had been smoking, and were begrimed with
dust, and looked like very ogres. The morning was splendid,
the sun, pouring out his beams in rich effulgence, gave
gladness to the bright scene, which we especially felt after
the cold weather to which we had, ever since our arrival in
France, been exposed. After leaving Toulon, the railway
goes inland and does not again touch the coast till it reaches
Frejus, 91 kilometres, or above 50 miles on; but the
country is very beautiful. This route, between Marseilles
and Genoa, and on to Pisa, passes through constantly-occurring
tunnels. It is said that between Marseilles and
Genoa alone there are no less than 200, and it certainly
looks like it. The train is for ever rushing into and
darting out of tunnels; and as French people never think
of closing windows in tunnels, and always put and keep
down the glass, the transit through them is very cold
and trying, particularly to invalids or to those who may be
afflicted with a cold in the head. After leaving Frejus, the
railway skirts the coast, and as the train emerges from a
tunnel, the passengers have the opportunity of seeing the
most lovely bays formed by the jutting promontories and
the blue Mediterranean. In saying they have the opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
however, this is a chance depending upon whether
there are no foreigners at the windows. If there be, most
mercilessly, and without leave asked, much less obtained,
down go the blue blinds on both sides of the carriage.
Fortunately, on this first occasion (I was not so lucky on
the second), I got seated near the south or sea window, and
managed to get one of the three curtains kept up; but just
as we approached within sight of Cannes, where the view
was becoming exquisitely beautiful, a little of the bright
sun darted in: the intruder was expelled in double haste,
and the blind most uncourteously and ruthlessly pulled
down. It saved some sunburnt ogre from being, if possible,
a little more browned or reddened, and it signified not that
his fellow-passengers were deprived of an enjoyment into
which he could not enter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VII.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>CANNES.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">When</span> we arrived at Cannes, we could see by an occasional
glimpse through a chink in the obstructive blinds, that
everything was bright and beautiful and gay in the sunshine.
It was quite a new scene to us, and gave a charming
idea of Riviera life.</p>

<p>Waiting the arrival of the Paris train at Cannes, there
are often, besides the usual very long row of omnibuses, many
private carriages and always carriages for hire. Relatives
had preceded us by about eight or ten days, and we
desired, if possible, to join them. Just outside the station,
looking for one of them, I was at once besieged by porters
wanting to take our <i>petits bagages</i>. I asked one by whom
I was importuned, how much he demanded to carry them
to our friends’ quarters, little more than half a mile off.
‘Five francs.’ I doubt if I thanked him sufficiently; and
we drove off in one of the little carriages which were there
waiting employment, the fare for which was 1 franc 50 centimes.
The house in which our friends were was full, and we
found accommodation in the neighbouring Hotel du Pavillon.
This is a large, good, first-class hotel, frequented by English
people, and is situated on the west bay, with a garden,
such as most of the hotels at Cannes have, in which were
palm and orange trees, the latter bearing their golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
fruit. They sent for our heavy luggage, which had been
lying for a week at the station, suffering no loss save that
of a new rope which had been tied round one of the boxes,
and which was feloniously stolen and theftuously away
taken, as in Scotland Her Majesty’s advocate for Her
Majesty’s interest would have charged the culprits if he
had only known who they were.</p>

<p class="p2">Cannes is very picturesquely situated. The old town,
which is not savoury, fortunately rests out of sight upon
an elevation or ridge which is crowned by the cathedral
church and two old towers, which give a distinctive mark
to the place, and are seen in most representations of Cannes.
From this height, and still better from greater heights
behind the town, an admirable view is obtained all round.
But taking our position on the ridge, we find the hill slopes
down from it away to the south, and reaching the road
below, extends seaward by a short projection, partly natural
and partly artificial, forming a breakwater on one side, and
pier on the other, terminated by a lighthouse. The ridge
and this projection divide the waters into two distinct
portions, constituting the east and west bays. About two
to three miles to the southward, Les Isles de Lerins, two long
strips of islands&mdash;Ste. Marguerite, with its fortifications fronting
the town, and St. Honorat&mdash;lie stretched along, giving a
natural shelter on the south to the little port of Cannes,
and, except in the neighbourhood of the fort, both covered
with tall pine trees. The harbour or port, surrounded on
two sides by lofty houses, warehouses, and public buildings
or hotels, is right under us, on the east side of the ridge, and
does not aspire to receiving more than a few sloops or vessels
of small burden and a large number of boats, apparently
intended principally for pleasure sailing&mdash;although, if
this be their purpose, the number seemed out of all proportion
to the slender demand. On the north side of this
bay, the new town&mdash;the business part of Cannes&mdash;has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
built. The main street, long, and lined with numerous
shops, runs through the centre of it, with streets branching
off right and left. It is the highway to Nice, and forms
part of the famous Corniche road, which proceeds from
Marseilles to Genoa along the coast. Immediately behind
the town, the ground rises, and at one part becomes a low
hill crowned by a few straggling houses and solitary trees.
A handsome promenade has been constructed along the
beach, upon which a few of the best hotels and some
magnificent villas, with their large interposing gardens full
of exotic trees and plants, are situated, imparting a bright
and gay look to the walk. About a mile and a half or two
miles to the eastward of our point of view, we see a range
of hills, the shoulder of which is called California. This
range, covered with pine trees, affords shelter to Cannes
from the east wind; and from its extremity at California, the
hill slopes sharply down, and then the ground runs far out
into the water, forming a projecting arm. The last portion,
of level ground, called the Croisette, reaches to a point
not far from the island of St. Marguerite, and constitutes
a natural breakwater to the bay and harbour on the east
side. Some miles farther to the eastward, the long, low,
hilly, narrow, projecting promontory called the Antibes
protrudes still more into the sea, and affords additional
protection, while it creates another fine bay, greater in
extent, in which a fleet of French men-of-war is often seen
lying at anchor or at exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>On the west side of the old ridge, the sea retreats in a
large, beautiful bay, called the Gulf of Napoule,&mdash;or more
commonly, the west bay,&mdash;the west boundary of which,
several miles distant across the sea, is formed by the
glorious range of mountains called the Estérels or Estrelles.
These stretch out a long way seaward, and are always a
picturesque feature in views of Cannes. They are covered
principally with a rich dark green, which, I suppose, is due
to the existence of pine forests; but in some parts, especially
towards the ocean, they are bare, steep, and rocky. Irregular,
and in some places even ragged-looking in outline, and
varying in height, some of them are said to be as high as
4000 feet. Though much less extensive, they are to Cannes
very much what the mountains of Mull are to Oban.
Only they have not the constantly-changing aspect which
confers so great a charm upon the Scottish hills. This is
partly owing to the greater serenity of the atmosphere,
three-fourths of the days being clear and sunny, without a
cloud; but chiefly because the sun gets so soon round upon
the mountains that they are early in the forenoon thrown
into shade, giving no doubt a murkier and grander aspect,
but making the separate markings less distinctly visible.
The Estrelles have been photographed as in moonlight, in
which they are very beautiful, but the moonlight effect so
shown is a mere trick of the photographer.</p>

<p>To the north of Cannes, and about three or four miles
inland, the village of Cannet lies upon rising ground; and, I
presume, from being away from the sea, it is preferred by
some invalids to Cannes. Farther off, and distant about
nine or ten miles from Cannes, the town of Grasse, famous
for its manufacture of perfumes, is built among gardens
devoted to the culture, for their essences, of roses, orange
trees, heliotropes, and other odoriferous plants. Indeed,
Cannes itself manufactures perfumes, and around are some
gardens filled with a short or stunted species of acacia,
growing to about the size of a large gooseberry bush, and
bearing globular yellow flowers from which perfume is
extracted. Beyond Grasse, the landward panorama is
bounded on the north by distant mountain chains.</p>

<p class="p2">It is at all times difficult to realize a place from description,
even with the aid of the pictorial art; but perhaps from
this short delineation it may be perceived that there is a
marked character about the site, locality, and features of
Cannes. But when to the natural formation the glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
colouring is added which it derives from the brilliant blue
of the ocean and the scarcely less brilliant blue of the sky
in the bright sunny days which usually mark the weather;
the rich varied greens of the abounding foliage; the tropical
character of the gardens; and the enlivening effect produced
by the often fanciful forms of the houses, painted in luminous
whites and yellows picked out upon their jalousies
with green and other contrasting tints, and glowing in their
red-tiled roofs, it will at once be seen that there must be
a signal beauty and picturesqueness about the landscape
which cannot fail to arrest the eyes of those to whom this
phase of scenery is new.</p>

<p class="p2">But Cannes was never a town of any importance until
Lord Brougham took up his residence there. It happened
in the year 1831 that his lordship was detained at Cannes
by the prevalence somewhere of a pestilence. He was so
much struck with the natural features of the landscape and
the suitability of the place for winter residence, and so impressed,
that he soon thereafter acquired ground on the west
bay, where he built a house, to which he used regularly
every winter to resort, and where, on 7th May 1868, he
died. His example brought many English people to the
locality, and Cannes is now in the winter season such a
place of fashionable resort for English and Scotch families,
that it may be regarded as completely an English colony,
there being but a sprinkling of other nationalities. It is
accordingly in both bays studded with villas, and filled with
numerous large hotels, the latter said to number upwards
of fifty. There are no less than three English (Episcopal)
churches, and in the west bay, near the town (the handsome
gift of Sir John M’Neill, who has a residence in the
suburbs), a Scotch Presbyterian church. There are also
both French and German churches. The population of
Cannes has increased wonderfully since Lord Brougham led
the fashion to it, and it is now, I believe, considerably over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
10,000. A monument has been erected to his lordship in
the cemetery where he is buried, and a marble bust of him
has, on a long square pillar pedestal, been placed in the
public gardens of the west bay. When we were last at
Cannes (November 1877), it was proposed by the municipal
authorities to hold a centenary celebration of the birth of
Lord Brougham as the virtual founder of the town; and
this festival has since (April 1879) been held, lasting four
days. Nor is it any wonder that the Cannais should feel
themselves under a debt of gratitude to the great English,
or rather Scottish, lord. The following paragraph from an
account of the fête, contained in the <i>Scotsman</i> of 4th April
1879, speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘It is a matter of unquestionable fact, that, since the days of Lord
Brougham’s example to his countrymen, prosperity has flowed steadily in
upon the fortunate people of Cannes. Those of them who were lucky enough
to possess land, have had golden opportunities, and must have made ample
fortunes out of the weak-chested but strong-pursed stranger to whom this
winter climate is simply a necessity of life. The price of ground here, fit
to build upon, is almost fabulous. Eight to ten thousand pounds an acre is
a common rate for small lots near the town, and a site was quite recently
sold, in the principal boulevard, at the enormous rate of £19,200 per acre.
Even in the remotest suburbs, outside the cab radius, nothing available
for building can be had under 10 francs a metre, or £1600 an acre.’</p>

<p class="p1">The Corniche road runs westward through, for upwards
of two miles, a nearly continuous line of charming villas,
and thence on to Napoule, upon the west of the bay of that
name. Upon the right or east side of this road, about half
a mile from the old town ridge, which may be said to
bound on the west the town proper, the villa of Lord
Brougham may be seen standing at the top of a gentle slope,
where it commands a beautiful view of the bay and the
Estrelles, though exposed to the west winds. It is of good
size, but nothing remarkable. We did not, however, see the
interior, nor does it seem to be shown to strangers. In
being enclosed by an iron railing towards the road, it offers
an exemplary exception to the rule, as nearly all the villas
in that direction are enclosed by high walls which shut out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the sight of the grounds within, and make the road for a
long stretch dull walking. Nor is there a footpath except for
a short way, although one was, when we were last there, in
progress of formation, and very needful too, as after rain
the road is particularly muddy, so that walking in that
direction is not always inviting. But generally on an afternoon,
when the occupants of the villas are out driving, their
gateways are left open, and passers-by get glimpses into
fascinating gardens exuberant with palm and other tropical
trees, which, freed from their unsightly enclosing walls, would
so enliven the way without the privacy of the inhabitants
being really disturbed.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most delightful residences in this neighbourhood
is the chateau of the Duke of Vallombrosa. This
Italian nobleman asked, as the sole recompense of services
rendered to the King of Italy, the title which he now
bears. His villa is in the castellated style, and stands
upon an eminence&mdash;a very picturesque object in the landscape,
and seen from all parts round. The grounds attached
to the house&mdash;extending, I suppose, to at least eight or ten
acres, and the oldest about Cannes&mdash;are, in the duke’s
absence, open to visitors. To those who have not previously
seen any gardens of the kind, it appears a sort of fairy-land,
if such a term can be applied to a place where much
of the timber is gigantic. The vegetation is rich, luxuriant,
tropical, and the place looks delicious on a sunny day, under
the cool shelter afforded by the trees from the rays of the
sun, while here and there a fountain sends up its refreshing
stream of water. Below the battlemented castle terrace, a
shady grotto has been built&mdash;a cool retreat in hot weather,
perhaps too cool to be safe. This garden contains many
lofty specimens of a tree recently introduced into the Riviera,
and everywhere to be seen there, called the Eucalyptus. A
relic of the Eocene period,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> when everything was on a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
scale, it shoots up with amazing rapidity, apparently
something like ten feet in a year, and I believe ultimately
reaches sometimes a height of nearly 500 feet. I have
seen it stated in a colonial paper that the largest known,
grown in (I think, speaking from recollection) New Zealand,
has reached the height of 480 feet, and is claimed to be the
highest tree in the world. Probably it is not of great age,
as the growth of the Eucalyptus is much more rapid than
that of the Californian trees. As it matures, it changes the
form of its leaf from what it was when young, and sheds
its bark. It possesses some very health-bringing properties,
or is an antidote to what is insalubrious, and bears a
beautiful white flower. In the duke’s gardens some of
these trees are very lofty. They were, I presume, planted
about twelve or fifteen years previous to our visit, and
appeared to be then considerably over 100 feet.</p>

<p>A hill called the Croix de Garde slopes up behind the
Villa Vallombrosa, or rather to the northward. It is several
hundred feet high, and its summit, crowned with pine
trees, commands an extensive prospect, and forms a delightful
walk to those who are able to make the ascent. The view
comprises the bays and all that I have already described.
A little iron cross, inserted in a stone upon the top, to
which no doubt some legend attaches, gives its name to the
height.</p>

<p class="p2">The Corniche road below, running between the lines of
villas, conducts to a little village called Verviers, about three
miles from town. Here there is a large forest of umbrella
pines bordering the coast, furnishing opportunities of study
to the artist and to the photographer, and where one can
enjoy a forenoon’s rambling about. The railway cuts the
forest off from the shore, and flanks the beach all the way
till it arrives close upon Cannes, and must therefore operate
injuriously to the amenity. So far as the villas are concerned,
they have, by means of bridges or otherwise, communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with the sea. Fortunately, however, for Cannes,
the railway leaves the coast about half a mile from town,
and passing through a tunnel proceeds by the back of the
town, where the station is.</p>

<p>From near the point where the railway diverges from the
shore, the public promenade on the west bay commences.
This is lined by palm trees, but the dust and the sea air
together seem inimical to their development. The main
promenade is that which, commencing with the harbour,
runs eastward to the point of Croisette, a distance of from
two to three miles. It is a great resort of visitors both on
foot and in carriages. A band of music plays alternate
days on the east and west bays. In each of these bays
there are bathing establishments of a construction peculiar
to the Riviera, being somewhat of the nature of the
Lacustrian dwellings. They are simply wooden sheds for
undressing and dressing in, resting upon poles stuck firmly
into the beach, with depending ladders to enable the
bathers to descend to the water. As the beach shelves
very rapidly down, I presume that bathers who cannot
swim must always be in charge of an attendant or be tied
by a rope; but whether it was that the bathing may have
taken place at an early hour, I have hardly ever seen any
person indulging in a bath at Cannes during our brief visits,
although the temperature is seldom such throughout the
winter as to forbid the exercise to persons in good health
either at this or at other parts of the province. I have
seen at Nice (a colder place than Cannes) people bathing
towards the end of November. By a strange fatality, for
one can hardly suppose it to be the result of deliberate
arrangement, we observed that close by each of the bathing
establishments a drain has been run into the sea, the same
practice occurring also at Biarritz. These drains are so
odoriferously disagreeable as to make it unpleasant to walk
along the promenade, while one would think that some
parts of Cannes ought in consequence to be unhealthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
At all events, they must to a certain extent nullify the
good got from residence at this otherwise agreeable and
fashionable watering-place.</p>

<p class="p2">Near the point of Croisette, there is a large orange
garden which has been dignified with the name of the
garden of the Hesperides. The oranges are cultivated for
sale, and the trees are covered with the yellow fruit. In
all the private gardens orange trees grow, and sometimes,
though rarely, lemons, which I understand do not flourish
at Cannes so well as elsewhere in the Riviera&mdash;a symptomatic
sign indicative of a colder climate; for the lemon
is a very delicate tree, requiring warmth and shelter, and
being injured or killed by frost. There are also many
arbutus trees in the gardens, bearing rich red soft berries
nearly an inch in diameter, which are edible, and become
ripe about November or December, and are sometimes, I
have been informed, put down as dessert at hotel tables.
The oranges do not ripen till February, although the fruit is
on the trees all the year round.</p>

<p>At Croisette there is a depôt for the sale of the earthenware,
tinted with a peculiar blue or with a livid green, of
which many fancy articles are made in the neighbouring
town of Vallauris; but the stuff is brittle, and it is not advisable
to purchase for bringing home any articles with
slender handles&mdash;they break so easily off, while they can be
bought at home in china shops.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the favourite drives is to California, upon the
slope of which some new large hotels have been built, from
which the views must be fine; but the situation, though
healthy, is rather inconveniently distant from the town, and
involves a pull up hill, which perhaps puts walking up
beyond the power of invalids. We drove there on the 18th
November. The sun had risen gloriously in the morning.
There was not a speck of cloud on the sky. The day was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
broiling hot, and it was difficult to realize that we were no
longer in July, but in a time of year when at home we
should have had cold wintry weather. So warm, indeed,
had we felt it at Cannes, that we were under the necessity
of throwing off the extra clothing we had donned at Paris
and Lyons. The road is steep, and the ascent fatiguing to
horse and man, to the point where the reservoir, which
supplies Cannes with water, is placed. Here we left the
carriage and climbed to the top of the hill over above, the
view from which amply repaid the exertion. Had we gone
to a farther height, we should have seen the Alpes Maritimes;
but from the height at which we arrived, the view was
magnificent, the Estrelles lying straight out to the west,
Antibes to the east, and the Lerins lying, to appearance,
almost below us to the south. In a glowing sunshine such
as we then had, the Mediterranean is always of a brilliant
deep blue, while the sky is also of a rich blue of a lighter
shade. One can hardly realize the beauty of the scenery
beheld on such a day without having previously witnessed
another like it. Such days would live in our recollection even
more than they do, were they not, during several months’
residence in the Riviera, of so frequent occurrence.</p>

<p class="p2">During the winter season, there is, for the accommodation
of visitors, a tiny steamer, perhaps about the magnitude of
Fulton’s first steamboat, mayhap the identical one, which,
for a fare of 2 francs (return ticket), crosses to the islands
of Ste. Marguerite and St. Honorat. We resolved to spend
a forenoon on Ste. Marguerite, and, with about twenty or
thirty passengers on board, crossed, leaving at eleven o’clock
and returning at four. The boat stopped at a little quay
below the high walls of Fort Monterey. Here we got out,
and the whole party landing, went up to see the fort, which
is doubly famous as the place where Bazaine was confined
and from which he escaped, and where ‘the man in the iron
mask’ was so long imprisoned. Like some other French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
forts, it is not at present occupied by soldiers, though a
regular fortification in masonry, and capable of affording
protection against vessels seeking to attack Cannes. A
man placed as resident in the fort accompanied us to the
rooms which had been occupied by Bazaine. The suite
of apartments was extensive, and bore anything but the
appearance of a prison-house. Except for the involuntary
confinement, one might regard it as a charming residence;
and in its recent occupation was a public remonstrance
against the barbarity of laws which imprison convicted persons
who have hitherto enjoyed a good social position in the
same cells as ordinary criminals, to whom such cells are in
truth more comfortable than their own miserable dirty homes.
We were then taken to the spot where it is said that
Bazaine escaped by descending the wall and rock. The
height is not great, and a descent in the daylight would be
no great achievement. It would no doubt be more difficult
and perhaps dangerous in the dark, and it is even alleged
that the Marshal was allowed to walk out by the gate.
There is no great improbability in this story, seeing that the
French had gained all they wanted by a condemnation of
this officer as a scapegoat for their want of success. The
room in which the ‘man in the iron mask’ was confined,
was much more like a prison&mdash;a cell with massive thick
walls. We saw the hole through which he is said to
have dropped the billet which was picked up by a fisherman.</p>

<p>There has been placed in this fort one of those semaphores
which are studded along the coast of France, by which
signals are or used to be made, and which, before the introduction
of the electric telegraph, were no doubt useful. From
the battlements we had a clear view of the magnificent
landscape before us, which embraced on the extreme
right distance the snowy peaks of the Maritime Alps. We
left the fort, and wandered over the island and through the
trees, with which the greater part of it is covered, lunched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<i>al fresco</i>, and enjoyed our forenoon very much. It is an
island we could have wished transported, with all its surroundings
and its sunshine, to our own shores.</p>

<p class="p2">We spent fifteen days on this occasion at Cannes. It is
a nice place for winter residence for those who are in good
health; but I doubt whether, notwithstanding the records of
the thermometer, it be sufficiently warm&mdash;at least, whether
it affords sufficient shelter&mdash;for delicate invalids, being
apparently a good deal more open to north and west winds
than some other places in the Riviera. Before we arrived,
there had been not a little rain, and the roads were very
dirty. While we remained, we had still more; but the usual
weather all along the Riviera is dry and fair, and it is of
dust one has most to complain. There is no river meriting
the name debouching within the limits of the town, although
their insignificant beds are speedily filled when heavy rain
falls.</p>

<p class="p2">Like most places on the Riviera, there is abundance of
marble used in the houses and hotels. It is not altogether
without its drawbacks and its dangers. Stair steps are
of marble, and it is requisite to be careful in descending.
On one occasion I slipped upon a marble step and fell on
my back, and might, had the fall been more direct, have
received permanent injury; but in the winter time carpets
are usually laid on the stairs.</p>

<p class="p2">It is said that there are snakes and venomous green
lizards. We never saw any snakes, and though there are
plenty of lizards running nimbly about and up the walls,
diving out of sight into hiding holes, yet sometimes leaving
a little of their long tails sticking out, I cannot vouch for
these being either venomous or innocuous. They look pretty
gentle creatures, and one is rather savage to see men and
boys throwing stones at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>A real pest, however, to which all are exposed at Cannes
and kindred places, is the plague of the mosquitoes, which
abound in hot weather. We were told they were off by
the 1st of November, but we found upon arrival at Cannes,
and throughout our stay there, that this insect plague
was in full force. It is a small gnat, with long legs and
yellowish-brown wing. The first thing that we did was to
kill as many as we could see resting on ceiling, walls, or
bed, and this is best effected by coming quickly down upon
them with a damp towel; but they are very agile, and
unless the arm be vigorous and prompt, they escape the
swish. They are also remarkably knowing and cunning,
and soon discover when an enemy is bent on their destruction,
when they manage unaccountably to disappear. Nay,
even without attack made, they will hide themselves
during the day, conscious that they will get a good feed
during the night. Every now and then they came buzzing
about you with a peculiar hum, which becomes more loud
just when the insect is about to strike. This it does by
driving its proboscis like a lancet into the skin, extracting
a drop of blood, and leaving behind, I fancy, a minute drop
of poison or other cause of irritation, producing a small red
mark. Most people do not suffer inconvenience from the
bite itself beyond the mark it leaves, and with which the
brow, a favourite point of attack, soon gets dotted over.
One lady at Cannes was so severely bitten that she could
hardly see, her eyes being nearly closed by the effects of
the bites, so much so as to prevent her coming to the table.
Another lady was so affected by the bites that the parts
bitten rose in large swellings, requiring her to consult a
doctor, by whom they were lanced; and the cure was
tedious, leaving long after marks on the skin. But the
great annoyance which they occasion is their tormenting
vicious hum, revealing their presence, and showing that at
any moment they may be down upon you. If you wake
through the night and hear this hum, it is impossible to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
any further sleep. If there be anything worse than a
mosquito humming about you, it is to have two of them;
but one is enough to keep you lively, and furnish you with
incessant employment; and where one is, there are generally
plenty more. Apparently the mosquito, like the king, never
dies, for as fast as one is slain another reigns in his stead.
All sorts of remedies for the bite are prescribed, but we
found that prevention is better than cure; and the most
effectual prevention, besides taking care to close windows
early and not to light a candle before closing, was to burn
a pastille, specially prepared for the purpose, by placing
it on an iron shovel, and just before bed-time carrying it
burning round the room and holding it within the bed
curtains. The smoke of it appears to stupefy the insect, although
it does not kill it; and in the morning the mosquitoes,
evidently wanting to get out to breathe the fresh air and
take their revenge at night, fly in a sickly condition to the
windows, where, or elsewhere about the room, they are
easily killed. When killed, a bloody streak is left, indicating
they have been fed somewhere. One extraordinary
circumstance is that, although the fecundity of this creature
is enormous,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> yet those which find their way into rooms are
comparatively few, and it puzzles one to know where the
rest go to. I believe the insect’s existence is not so much
due to great heat as to bad drainage. We found Cannes to
be worse than Mentone, and Hyères worse than Cannes;
but by Christmas-time, when cold weather has set in, they
nearly vanish, although, when a fire is lighted, sometimes
they are either attracted or revived, but are then in a
weakly condition.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>NICE.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> were due at Mentone on Wednesday the 29th
November, and intended to have spent two nights at Nice
by the way; but the Monday was so very wet at Cannes
that we delayed leaving till the Tuesday morning, and by
so doing obtained a brilliant day for the short but delightful
railway ride. Passing the Croisette, we first skirted the Bay
of Antibes, where the French squadron was then lying at
anchor, and in which is the spot, denoted by a commemorative
monument, where Napoleon Bonaparte landed from
Elba. A little farther, the distant snowy Maritime Alps
came into view. Here, as elsewhere in the Riviera, curious
villages, looking very dead-alive under their rotten brown
roofs, are seen upon the tops of hills. These villages were
so built in the olden times, with the view of securing some
protection from the Moors, who, crossing the Mediterranean
from Algeria to capture the inhabitants for slaves, kept
them in terror when they landed. We passed over the
wide course of the Var, and in about an hour from departure
arrived in the gay town of Nice.</p>

<p class="p2">Nice is a large town in the province of Nice, formerly
part of the Sardinian kingdom, when the boundary line
between France and Italy lay about four miles to the westward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the town. Ceded to France, it is now the capital
of the French department of the Alpes Maritimes. The
population, which forty years ago was 34,000, is now
stated by Bædeker to be 50,000; but as the town has been
from year to year rapidly extending under the influence of
the railway facilities, and now covers a large area, it is
probable that this estimate is much under the mark, and
that it numbers greatly more. Arriving by the railway, the
station is left, and the town entered by a wide handsome
street or boulevard called the Avenue de Longchamps.
This leads straight down to the Place Massena and the
Pont Neuf, where are the public gardens, the Promenade des
Anglais, the Boulevard du Midi, and other noted parts.
The river Paillon passes through Nice, and is crossed near
its mouth by the Pont Neuf.</p>

<p>Nice is a very lively place, and in some respects is
attractive. The town is well laid out, and it has many
good shops, though none of them large. It is a commercial
town, but does not possess many notable public buildings.
The cathedral lies in a quarter I never visited; but a handsome
Roman Catholic church, externally large, but internally
contracted, has been recently built of a fine white stone,
and forms a feature in the avenue. The streets, houses, and
hotels are imposing. The Promenade des Anglais is a long
wide roadway along the beach, extending westward between
one and two miles; and upon its landward side, many of the
largest and best hotels, a theatre, and other buildings have
been erected. This promenade is the great resort, particularly
on a Sunday, of the inhabitants and visitors, and
it has certainly a magnificent aspect. A handsome iron
bridge of three arches over the Paillon connects it with the
Boulevard du Midi, which forms a continuation eastward
towards the harbour.</p>

<p class="p2">Nice was, and I suppose still is, a free port, and therefore
possesses some advantages. Its harbour affords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
accommodation for many large ships. Before reaching it,
however, and to the south-east of the town, a hill interposes,
rising abruptly above 300 feet high, popularly called the
Chateau, of which castle, however, nothing is now left but its
ruins. The slopes of the hill are covered with trees, many
of them exotics, through which the road winds gently to
the top. We drove up this winding road to the harsh
music of innumerable French drummers and trumpeters (one
would have thought the tyros of all France were here
assembled) practising upon their respective instruments all
sorts of disagreeable rat-tats and military signals of contradictory
import in dinning, hoarse, distracting, discordant,
ear-cracking immaturity&mdash;a very Babel of uncertain sounds,
tending to realize, perhaps faintly, the Highlander’s
dream of heaven,&mdash;that delectable thought of ‘four and
twenty bagpipers all in one room, and all pleyin’ different
chunes.’ Nevertheless, every visitor desirous of obtaining the
best view of Nice and its environs should make the ascent,
previously bribing the concierge to ascertain if possible at
what hour the unhappy musicians dine or otherwise disappear.
On the top of the hill there is a platform, from
which is obtained a most striking panoramic view. Below,
on one side, lie the harbour, and the hills beyond to the
eastward, over which the Corniche road proceeds to Mentone
and Genoa; then on the south, the beautiful Mediterranean
Sea, hemmed in by promontories, and basking and glittering
in the sun; westward, the promenades; and thence northwards
and eastwards, the city, bounded in the distance by
mountains. But what arrested our attention most was the
extraordinary torrent bed of the river Paillon. Crossing
the Var, we had seen a similar bed, and much wider. In
a railway train, however, one has little opportunity of
catching more than a passing glimpse of things, especially
when the railway line is nearly on the same level. But
from the platform of the chateau we were looking down
upon the bed of the Paillon from a considerable elevation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which enabled us to see up the course of the river for some
miles away to the mountains, where it became lost to view.
As the torrent beds are a remarkably characteristic feature
of the Riviera, I may just describe their appearance. The
bed or channel of the river consists of a broad stony course,
through which usually a streamlet trickles; the bed being
out of all proportion to the size of the stream as usually
seen. It is, however, stony, and no grass grows in it;
and sometimes, after heavy rains or from snowy meltings,
the water comes down from the mountains in torrents, and
more or less covers the channel from side to side, even
occasionally, when the rains are more than ordinarily protracted,
flooding it considerably&mdash;a fact which I believe the
contractors in forming the railway found to their cost.
But although we have seen heavy rains lasting for days
together, I do not think that, with one exception, we ever
witnessed such a flow of water in any of the river beds as
completely to cover it. The strange aspect of the river
course, however, is produced by men continually digging
into it when and where dry, and riddling out the fine limy
earth which has been borne down from the uplands, and
carting it away for building and other purposes; by doing
whereof they leave behind them all over it large holes and
little heaps of riddled-out stones, imparting a very mottled
and singular appearance to the channel. The river Paillon,
therefore, extending for miles in this condition, had a most
novel and extraordinary aspect from the chateau. Although
there had been heavy rain the day before, the stream was
very diminutive.</p>

<p class="p2">We stayed but one night at Nice, although we went
several times afterwards from Mentone to spend the day
there. I do not therefore pretend to know it well. It is
the most expensive town in the Riviera, but is alluring to
those who go in good health for pure enjoyment. For
promotion of enjoyment and gaiety, it is, I presume, everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that can be desired; but although the climate is better
than that of some other places, being, it is said, equal or
similar to the climate of Florence, it wants the shelter
which is so necessary to invalids. The mountains are not
near enough to afford protection, and cold winds, keen and
piercing, blow down the streets, very trying to delicate
constitutions, especially to those suffering from pulmonary
complaints. In fact, it would seem to be the battle-ground
of all the villainous winds which afflict the south. The
<i>bise</i>, the <i>marin</i>, the <i>tramontane</i>, the <i>mistral</i>, the <i>sirocco</i>, are
in continual conflict for the ascendency; and sometimes the
one and sometimes the other has it, and enjoys its triumph
for a few days in dealing misery on the inhabitants. To
many the sea-breeze is most trying. I met on one occasion,
on the railway, a gentleman in bad health returning from
Nice to Rome because he could not stand its sea-breeze.
But given good strong health and a relish for the kind of
life, and Nice is charming.</p>

<p>The hotels and pensions are legion in number; but those
considered good by English people, it is well to know, are
costly.</p>

<p>Theatres, skating rinks, bathing, exhibitions of paintings
and sculpture, each in turn claims patronage, while delightful
excursions by carriage can be made to places of interest
in the neighbourhood. There is a constant stir of life in
Nice, aided not a little by military promenades and military
music, a band playing each afternoon in the public
gardens.</p>

<p class="p2">But we were impatient to be off to Mentone, which, from
all we could learn before leaving home, was thought to be
the most desirable of all the health resorts in the Riviera
for winter residence. Our friends had preceded us from
Cannes, and secured quarters for us in the same hotel with
themselves.</p>

<p>The carriage road from Nice to Mentone, about 24<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
miles, is one of the most charming parts of the Corniche
drive, and, if weather be not cold and expense be no
obstacle, it ought, unless the traveller be an invalid, to
be preferred to the railway, which, although it skirts the
Mediterranean just at a sufficient elevation to give a charm
to the view of its lovely waters, suffers the great drawback
of passing through numerous tunnels, some of them long.
On the other hand, the drive by road, for which 40 and
even 50 francs are asked (though less will be taken),
rises at one part to a great height, overlooking the ocean,
and being there on the top of the hills, is without protection
from the cutting north wind.</p>

<p>It was not warm enough to warrant our venturing to
drive, and we decided to go by rail. Soon after leaving
the station at Nice, we crossed the torrent bed of the
river Paillon, but were still in the town or suburbs of
Nice, and in the midst of orange gardens, the fruit shining,
like everything else, in the brilliant sun. At the other end
of a long tunnel we reached Villefranche, where the gulf
of that name presents a large natural harbour, in which one
or more men-of-war are sometimes to be seen. From this
point the railway hugs the coast, passing under or through
the hills by tunnels, whereby many fine points of view are
missed, and particularly the sight of Eza, a curious town
perched on a precipitous rock, formerly a Saracen free-booter’s
stronghold. The Corniche road is more inland, and
commands the whole prospect uninterruptedly. As the train
emerged from these tunnels successively, bay after bay,
filled with the beautiful blue Mediterranean water, hemmed
in by rocky promontories, upon which lonely trees sometimes
grow, met our sight, but, most tantalizingly, immediately
after disappeared from view, eclipsed by the next tunnel.
At last, after rather more than half way to Mentone, the bold,
peculiar rocky promontory of Monaco, for which we had been
watching, appeared, stretching out like a tongue of land, or
rather a long steep rock, into the ocean. The view of Monaco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
either from west or from east is very striking. The rock is
from 200 to 300 feet high, and dips perpendicularly into the
ocean, crowned by the town, the handsome palace of the
Prince of Monaco, and by fortifications. It is inaccessible
on three sides, and can only be reached by a fortified road
upon the east side sloping up the side of the rock. Upon
the north end, which is also steep and inaccessible, it is connected
at the bottom by a low narrow belt of land. I shall,
however, recur to Monaco in describing a visit to Monte
Carlo, which lies about half a mile to the eastward. After
leaving Monaco station, the passenger, looking down, sees on
the ground below, and leading up to Monte Carlo, a number
of villas, pure and bright in their colouring, looking so clean
and tidy in the sunshine with which on this occasion we
were again favoured. Monte Carlo is not well seen from
the railway, as the line and station lie below and even in
part under it. All trains stop both at Monaco and Monte
Carlo, and at the latter place they generally set down and
take up a considerable number of people, who resort either
to the gaming tables, or to the delightful gardens which
surround them, or to the music room of the Casino.
Leaving Monte Carlo, we came in sight of another long projecting
though not precipitous point of land, or rising hill
ground, covered with trees, principally dark pines. This,
the promontory of Cape Martin, is the west boundary and
termination of the western protecting arm of Mentone. It
necessitates another long tunnel, escaping from which, and
passing extensive terraces or forests of old olive trees, and
crossing two river courses, we at last arrived at our long
anticipated destination, the subject of many thoughts
during past months&mdash;Mentone.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>MENTONE.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> union of bold grandeur with soft loveliness in the
Mentone landscape, arrest and powerfully strike the eye
upon arrival. Familiarity with its scenery, after a residence
of months, scarcely dims the first impression. We had
heard much in a general way regarding it even before leaving
home, but every expectation was at once far exceeded by the
reality. We had just left Cannes and Nice, and witnessed
them both in their brightest aspects; but Mentone in its
natural features, and seeing it, as we did, for the first time,
in glorious sunshine, threw them both into the shade. It
was an agreeable surprise, and made us instantly feel that
a more beautiful spot for winter residence could not have
been chosen.</p>

<p class="p2">Originally the town of Mentone consisted simply of a
collection of high old houses, rising ridge upon ridge like
so many terraces resting upon the steep slope of a hill,
the crest of which was at one time crowned by a castle
or palace of the old feudal lords, now converted into a
picturesquely-situated cemetery. This hill or ridge, with
its curious old houses,&mdash;among or above which the cathedral
and other churches stand, from which there rise two elegant
minaret-like spires, one taller than the other, conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
from every quarter round,&mdash;forms a very striking object,
especially when seen from the east, and from that side may
be said in miniature to resemble a little, though of a
different character, the old town of Edinburgh, which, however,
is far more lofty and extends at least ten times farther.
The harbour or port of Mentone lies at the bottom of the
seaward end of this ridge. Curious old high houses, resting
upon odd long-shaped water-worn rocks, the terminals of the
hill, abut and hem in the harbour on the north or land side;
while on the south side, a long breakwater is in course of
formation for protection from the ocean waves, which, coursing
over the whole width of the Mediterranean Sea without
interruption, occasionally, under the pressure of a south-west
wind, dash up and over with great vigour. An old
building, at one time a small castle, standing at the end of
the original pier, makes an object in the landscape, and
perhaps could tell some tales. The water in the port is
extremely shallow, so that the anchorage is only adapted
for vessels of a small size, of which there are always a
few moored to the quays. The hill ridge, with the projecting
pier, form, similarly to Cannes, the dividing line
between what are termed the east and west bays.</p>

<p class="p2">The books which have been recently written on Mentone,
particularly those of Dr. Bennett and of Mr. William
Chambers, but more than any book, the good reports of
visitors, have induced such an influx of winter dwellers
from distant lands as to have created a new town in both
bays. Rather, it may be said that the hotels extend in
both directions, for in reality the newer parts of Mentone
are made up chiefly of lines of large hotels, the street or
shop part of the town being only a necessary sequence.
From the ridge eastward to the gaping gorge of St. Louis,
which is now the boundary line between France and Italy,
the distance by road is about two miles. Hotels line upon
one side nearly the first mile, the other side being open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the sea, and villas dot the remainder of the way. From the
gorge, south or seaward, a mountain called Belinda (1702 feet)
springs up, and from its shoulder a promontory juts out to the
sea and forms the termination of the east projecting arm of
the bays. From the north side of the gorge a mountain
range rises more loftily into the majestic Berceau and Grande
Montagne, and, stretching away to the north and north-west,
form the great shield to Mentone from the east and
north-east winds. These mountains attain an elevation of
about (more or less) 4000 feet,&mdash;the Grande Montagne being
stated by one authority to be 4525 feet,&mdash;and show themselves
boldly and almost perpendicularly in some parts like
enormous colossal walls of bare rock. Due north from Mentone,
and from two to three miles distant from it, another
chain of mountains lies almost at right angles right across
from east to west&mdash;St. Agnes in the centre, and behind it
the high and sharply-pointed Aigle (4232 feet high)&mdash;affording
shelter from the north winds; while the Agel
(3730 feet high), and some other lesser mountains,
terminated by the long promontory of Cape Martin, all
lying from north to south, afford shelter from the west
and north-west winds, and particularly the cold mistral.
Within these greater mountain chains, a series of high
ridges or hills standing in front, or issuing out of them
like huge tumuli, all covered with olives in terraces,
afford additional shelter; so that were it possible for the
wind to blow down the outer rampart, it would be withstood
by this inner wall or circle of lesser heights, some of
which are 1000 feet high. In the distance on the other
side of the great mountains, but invisible from Mentone, the
Maritime Alps rise to a height of from 5000 to 9000 feet.
It will thus be seen that the configuration of the mountains
is that of a great semicircle, and that on every side save the
south or sunny side, open to the sea, Mentone has protection
from the cold winds which in reality blow over the
tops of these great walls and strike at some distance away,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
north or prevailing winter wind reaching the sea some
miles out. It cannot be said that the cold of the winds is not
felt, but it is so greatly averted or modified that Mentone
is practically sheltered; and hence it is that, coupled with
the long continuance during the winter of dry open sunny
weather and the absorption and radiation of the sun’s heat
in and from the limestone rocks, it becomes so admirable
a place for the invalid.</p>

<p class="p2">Our quarters were in the west bay, considered to be more
bracing and less relaxing than the other, which is said to
be three degrees warmer, and, from being so, and more enclosed
and protected, better suited to the extremely delicate.
The hotels and houses in the west bay&mdash;in which is also
situated the new or shop portion of the town&mdash;extend,
though not continuously, about a mile; and there has been
formed in front, by the border of the sea, a roadway called
the Promenade du Midi,&mdash;a good and fairly-wide pleasant
road for foot-passengers and carriages,&mdash;which is, in the early
part of the forenoon, the great resort of invalids and other
strangers, who here meet their friends, and can view the
sea uninterruptedly in their walks, or enjoy a book or a
newspaper on one of the many seats provided for the weary
or lazy. A low stone-built bulwark protects the promenade
from being washed away by the sea, which sometimes,
though very rarely, sweeps up forcibly in heavy waves, and
even occasionally in a storm, so as to dash over the road.
But when the wind is from the north, the sea retires under
its pressure 60 to 100 feet from the bulwark, and there is
scarcely a ripple upon the water, which then looks like one
sheet of blue glass. And this is its predominating or normal
condition during the winter. When the waves come, they
trundle over monotonously, without gaining or losing a step.
It is the great drawback of the Mediterranean that it has no
tide, or a tide that is all but imperceptible. The difference
between high and low water at Mentone is only from two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to three feet. The consequence is, that the sea does not
carry away sufficiently the impurities which are conveyed
to it; and there is wanting that interesting feature of a
tidal beach, the change from hour to hour of the appearance
of the shore. It is only right, however, to add, that
Mentone enjoys comparative immunity from the noisome
influence of exposed drainage. Small drains only empty
into the west bay; and they are not particularly offensive,
though they might be improved by carrying pipes down into
the water,&mdash;only the likelihood is, that the first storm would
sweep them away. Another empties in the east bay, at the
corner formed by the junction of the old town at its north
end with the shore. This is at all times disagreeable to
passers-by, and must be insalubrious to those residing in its
neighbourhood. But it seems difficult to understand how
Mentone is drained, unless the east pipe conveys the great
bulk of the sewerage to the sea; although, so far as the old
town is concerned, it has been explained that the natives
collect all manure to carry it off to the country, thus combining
thrift with cleanliness. That the town is not as yet
so disagreeable as Cannes, may arise from the population
being greatly smaller. When Mentone increases much, as
it is threatening to do, it may be quite as discernible.</p>

<p class="p2">I have never seen any place so strikingly enclosed as
Mentone is by its semicircle of mountains and the minor
hill ridges. The higher parts of the mountains are steep,
rocky, and bare; but all over the ridges, and far up away
into the mountains, the olive tree is cultivated in terraces
built for their reception. The orange and lemon trees
mingle with the olives at a lower elevation, and in some,
especially the higher parts, pine trees furnish a deep green
covering. But all combined add a rich beauty to the
imposing grandeur of the scene. Some of the buildings also
contribute materially to the effect. On the summit of a
lofty ridge, between the Carrei and Boirigo valleys, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
monastery conspicuously rears its head. On the other
heights there are houses of peculiar construction, curiously
painted; and the whole place is dotted over with bright-coloured
villas, of all tints and shades of white and yellow,
relieved by the almost invariable roofing of red tiles, and the
usual gay greens of the outside venetian jalousies. But
next to the mountain heights, the most marked lineaments
of the Mentone scenery are its valley depths or
ravines between the various ridges, and in which rivers find
their beds, although in the dry weather which generally
prevails they are but trickling streams, and in some cases
usually almost dry. The greater valleys are three&mdash;or
rather, it may be said, four&mdash;in number, consisting of two
larger, with their torrent beds, the Carrei and Boirigo; a
third, containing a smaller river course, the Gorbio; and a
fourth, the Mentone valley and streamlet, the smallest of all,
but obtaining its name from, or giving it to, the old town,
at the bottom of which, or underneath the streets, the rivulet
passes. The valleys, three of them of considerable width,
in which these rivers run, form beautiful adjuncts to the town;
and the torrent beds, which are not so long or so wide as
those at Nice, are striking without being distasteful to the eye.</p>

<p class="p2">Such are the general outlines of the landscape. I shall
have to recur to some of them hereafter. To those who can
appreciate scenery, the <i>tout ensemble</i> cannot fail to produce
a feeling of intense admiration; but added to all, there is
that which lends its peculiar charm to Mentone. This is
its rurality. While it contains many large hotels, which do
not contribute much to the adornment of the scene,&mdash;though
year by year becoming more essential to meet the demands
for accommodation,&mdash;none of the buildings in Mentone
possess the palatial appearance of those at Nice, neither in
the large hotels nor in the street buildings. Indeed, with
regard to the latter, there is only one street proper in
Mentone, not half a mile long. On issuing from the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
station, which stands on high ground, the town is, or
was, hid from view by a curtain of trees, which afford a
beautiful fringe to the ocean, seen lying placidly beyond.
The road to town is along an avenue of tall plane trees by
the bank of the Carrei, one of the torrent beds. The road
on the other side of the Carrei is also flanked by trees, as
yet young. On arriving at the main road, which crosses
the river bed by a wooden suspension bridge, there is a piece
of ground, not large, on either side, laid out as a public
garden. From this point, the road each way, east and west,
continues to be lined with plane trees. The villas passed
on the way are built in gardens, wherein orange, lemon,
pepper, and palm trees grow; and so it is everywhere,
except in the heart of the town. I fear much that, from
year to year, as people continue to flock to Mentone, and
more lodging-room becomes requisite (for in sixteen or
eighteen years Mentone has risen from being, so far as
strangers are concerned, a mere wayside stopping-place to
its present ample dimensions, embracing a native population
of above 5000, besides a stranger population of probably
3000 more), and as land becomes in consequence more
valuable, this peculiar charm of rurality will disappear;
and though, mainly from the impossibility of its becoming a
great seaport, it will never be a large commercial town
like Nice; and although it will always continue to possess
natural features which no buildings can obliterate, and
which neither Nice nor any other town wanting them can
secure, yet it may in time rival in towny aspect such a
place as Cannes, which is at present very considerably larger.</p>

<p class="p2">As the first duty of the visitor is to see to his quarters,
it is only right here to make some observations relative to
the hotels such as they were during our stay. They were
then reckoned, in 1877, to amount to forty-four in number;
but the number is year by year increasing, and at least one
large hotel (the National) has been built since we left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
although the advertisements do not disclose its whereabouts.
The hotels are found either fronting the sea or back from it,
and either in the west or the east bay; and as the question
of locale is not unimportant, invalids should endeavour in this
respect to suit their particular case, noting, too, that, like
every other place, some hotels are more expensive than others.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for those who have not been previously
in Mentone, or who have not secured apartments before
arriving, to take rooms for a night in the Hotel Mediterranée
or the Hotel Royal, or some other hotel in the town
(of which there are several), and then look about. At the
beginning of the season there is abundance of choice; but
if the visit be delayed, as so often is the case, till after
Christmas, it is not unlikely to be discovered that the best
rooms have, for the most part, been taken; and it is much
more difficult to secure what is suitable, and especially good
south or sun-visited rooms. When such delay is unavoidable,
the better course is, if possible, to write to a friend in
Mentone previously to make inquiries and engage rooms.
In the spring, many migrate from Cannes and Nice on to
Mentone, <i>en route</i> a little later for Italy. As proximity to
the sea air, or to be within hearing of the monotonous noise
of the waves, does not suit some persons, while the proximity
may benefit others, and as the temperature of the east and
west bays differs considerably, it is not inadvisable for
those in delicate health to consult a medical man, who
should decide which part of Mentone is best suited to the
particular case. There are about twenty doctors practising
in Mentone. Of these, the English doctors are, I believe,
the following:&mdash;In the west bay, Drs. Siordet, Marriott,
Gent, and Sparks; and in the east bay, Dr. Bennett. It
is also well to know that the fees of the resident English
medical men are high, and are paid at each visit. If the
visit be to two persons of the same party, two fees, I have
been told, are charged or expected. The fees of the French
medical men are greatly less. It would seem, on some points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the doctors of the two countries differ,&mdash;as, for example,
English doctors advocate sitting in the sun, and foreign
doctors, sitting in the shade; and knowing how foreigners
abhor their friend the sun, I can well believe they do.</p>

<p>In viewing the hotels in order to make a selection, it
will be observed that some are more sheltered than others,
and a certain preference may be given to those which
seem to be the better protected from the north wind,
which in winter months, especially during December and
January, prevails and blows sometimes with a piercing cold
during night and in the morning. I am afraid this is
a circumstance but seldom studied by the builders of the
hotels, for I suspect there are few houses&mdash;particularly
on the Promenade du Midi&mdash;which are not exposed to cold
in consequence of having doors opening to the north side.
This of itself is not desirable, and perhaps in most cases is
unavoidable; but the evil is increased when such door is
in direct communication with the staircase without outer
porch and lobby, or if a corridor connect it with an entrance
on the other or south side. Considering, also, how important
it is for invalids that the temperature in-doors should be
maintained throughout the house at a proper degree, I have
been surprised to find that means are not universally taken
to heat the staircases and lobbies, delicate people being very
apt to suffer great harm by passing out of heated rooms
into cold corridors. So far as I am aware, there is but
one hotel in Mentone which fully attends to this important
particular&mdash;the Hotel des Îles Britanniques. Possibly,
however, there may be others. If not, this may be taken
as a valuable hint.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The rate of pension varies according to the hotel and to
the floor, and runs from 8 to 16 francs per day, exclusive
of wine, candles, and firewood.</p>

<p>To those who prefer taking either a furnished house or
rooms in a lodging-house, choice of villas or rooms can be
had in abundance at very varying rates, but generally, like
the hotels, high. The number of villas is constantly on the
increase. When last in Mentone, there were no fewer
than about 250. During a bad season, many remain unlet.
Lists of houses can be had from the house-agents, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the principal apparently was M. Amarante, Avenue Victor
Emanuele.</p>

<p>An institution maintained by subscription, and called
Helvetia, provides at a small rate of board (£1 per week),
a home for, I believe, fifteen invalid ladies, who are not in
circumstances to incur the much heavier expense of boarding
at a hotel.</p>

<p class="p2">Six Roman Catholic churches supply the wants of the
Roman worshippers in Mentone.</p>

<p>There are two English Episcopal churches. One, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
west bay, succeeds in obtaining good music and good congregations.
The chaplain of this church was till recently
the Rev. W. Barber, who, after officiating for many years,
died on 24th February 1878, and was succeeded by his
assistant, the Rev. Henry Sidebottom. One of Mr. Barber’s
sons was the able organist and choirmaster. The other
and earlier church in the east bay, built in 1863, is more
simple in its services, and, I fear, was therefore not so
much in favour as the more fashionable chapel in the
west bay, to which, notwithstanding the distance, many of
the east bay visitors resorted. The regular minister was
Mr. Morant Brock. But last winter (1877-78) his place
was supplied by Mr. Boudillon, the author of some books,
and a good old man.</p>

<p>The Free Church of Scotland has Presbyterian service
in a room of a villa in the east bay; but, whether owing
to the distant and elevated situation, or to not having a
church building, or to the paucity of Scotch people, it was
generally attended by only a few, though the small room
was filled when the preacher was popular.</p>

<p>There were also a German church and a French Protestant
church, the latter being under the pastoral care of
M. Delapierre. The Scotch church had no afternoon
service, while that held in the French church in the afternoon
was usually poorly attended. A good arrangement
might be, were the Scotch to give up their room, for which
they pay £30 per annum, and to have the use of the French
church for one service in the afternoon; and the second
French service might, with advantage in that case, be held
in the evening.</p>

<p class="p2">Having had occasion to make inquiry for a good school,
we found most highly recommended an excellent French
school kept by M. and Mme. Arnulf in a house adjoining
the Hotel Bristol, and which was attended by young ladies
from several of the principal hotels. The teachers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Roman Catholics; but many of their pupils being Protestants,
they made a point of avoiding any allusion to
religion in their classes. The school was mainly intended
for girls, but M. Arnulf had a class for boys. French,
music, and the ordinary elementary branches of education,
including a little English, were taught, the pupils receiving
tuition also in drawing from M. Bouché, who paints pretty
little pictures of Mentone, which are occasionally seen in
book-shop windows for sale, and which are valuable to
purchasers as agreeable reminiscences of their visit. The
charge for all branches, music included, for the hours
from 9 till 12 (lunch hour), six days per week, was 90
francs per month; if lunch and additional hour’s tuition
were taken, then so much more. Mme. Arnulf, a most
pleasing French lady, had an excellent mode of retaining
the interest of the pupils by giving a donkey excursion
party (which all the young people could attend) about
once a month. This was looked forward to by all the
scholars with great glee, and sad was the disappointment
if any unexpected sickness seemed likely to disable
one of them from being of the cavalcade. In their daily
walks, the young people were freely allowed to play after
getting out of town, showing a great amount of good
sense in the management of children, of which in other
parts of France, I have seen it stated, teachers are in this
respect innocent.</p>

<p>Young ladies and others can likewise obtain lessons
in Italian, music, and other branches from resident masters
and governesses. Young men who are not invalids are
scarce in Mentone, and I doubt whether, in the midst
of so much else to attract, their ardour for study is
intense.</p>

<p>A botany class was successfully formed during the winter
of 1877-78 by Mr. Henry Robertson, a visitor. The study
of botany is very suitable for the Riviera.</p>

<p>Pianofortes can be hired for the season, though not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the month; but the charge made is usually high&mdash;from
150 to 300 francs.</p>

<p class="p2">There is, besides a public library, a small museum of
natural history, etc., in the Hotel de Ville, consisting principally
of flint implements found in the caves of the Rochers
Rouges, and of specimens of snakes, fishes, and other animals
caught in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A theatre exists, but the performances seem to be rare.
I never was in it.</p>

<p>In an open place or square, there is what is called the
Cercle Philharmonique, or Club, admission to which is by
ballot and subscription (annual, monthly, or by the season).
Here are held concerts, dances, and occasional dramatic
entertainments, while newspapers lie in the reading-room.</p>

<p>Two newspapers are published in Mentone&mdash;the <i>Avenir</i>
and <i>Le Mentonnais</i>; but newspapers from Marseilles, Nice,
and other places are brought by train daily, and are procurable
at the railway station, shops, and a kiosk, or covered
round stall in the middle of the Place Nationale.</p>

<p class="p2">Having given this general description of Mentone, and
noted some of the institutions which are of the nature
of essentials to the visitor’s comfort, and being now settled
down in the place for the winter, the natural wish is to
know what is to be seen which will help to make residence
agreeable.</p>

<p>There are various guide-books<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> which may be bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and consulted for this purpose, and it is no part of my plan
in these pages to take their place or to describe after their
manner. One of them, titled, <i>The Splendide Hotel Handbook
to Mentone and its Environs</i>, would be more useful
were it less of a puff of the Splendide Hotel, which really
does not require any puffing. This book, in tagging and
dragging the unhappy hotel into almost every paragraph,
reminds one of De Foe’s puff of <i>Drelincourt on Death</i>, which
he brought or endeavoured to bring into notice by repeated
mention of it in his remarkable <i>Vision of Mrs. Veal</i>. The
author of the guide&mdash;(who doubtless laughs in his own
sleeve and not that of De Foe)&mdash;mentions that there are
fifty-nine excursions from Mentone, all of which he describes
shortly, and I would refer to the book for its recital. Fifty-nine
is a tolerably large number, and will, in any view, afford
constant employment to those who are of an exploring disposition.
However, people cannot always be on the trot,
more especially if they be not in strong, good health. Much
less will suffice for ordinary existence, and if all be accomplished
in three or four winters, these winters will not have
witnessed inactive lives. The number, however, is an odd
one; and to make it even, I must add one which the writer
fails to describe. It fell to my lot the very first night.</p>

<p class="p2">I was impatient to look about me, and on the evening of
my first day took, with a young Scotch gentleman residing
in the hotel, a walk as far as the gorge of St. Louis. It is
the evening aspect of Mentone which I regard as my first
and the additional excursion, and it is one of, if it be not,
the most lovely. The moon was full and shining brightly.
Now, the moonlight at Mentone is so clear and strong that
everything comes out sharply, and all objects on which it
rests are seen with almost the same distinctness as in daylight.
Even quarter moon illuminates surprisingly. The
great orb of night sheds her effulgence upon the grand, steep,
abrupt mountains, upon the rugged rocks, upon the glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
trees, upon the hill-tops, upon the white houses, upon
all I have already attempted to depict as contributing
to the magnificence of the landscape. Bold and varied as
everything looks, as usually seen when the sun is in the
heavens, the soft, wondrous silvering on the parts which
are moonlit, set in contrast against the deep, sombre, unrelieved
blackness of the parts which are cast into shade,
developes the features of the panorama, with an impressive
<i>chiaro oscuro</i> effect which can never be observed or attained
in the broad light of day; while, turning round and looking
upon the ocean below, we see the waves roll softly ashore
in lambent lines of dazzling light, and the yielding water
is dancing and glancing with the restrained restlessness of
girlish glee, and tossing up little flickering tongues of fire,
which cover the sea in the moonlight gleam as with thousands
of short-lived electric sparks, darting up to snatch a kiss from
their pale but glorious mother, and expiring in the vain and
feeble effort. We had not far to go for this lovely tableau,
which, when beheld for the first time, produces the sensation
of being in the presence of a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p class="p2">But the scene is scarcely less beautiful, though different,
when, the sky being clear, and especially on those evenings
which are slightly touched by frost, the moon averts her
face; for then the stars assemble with a twofold brilliancy,
sparkling with a lustre which is unknown in our dull and
foggy northern clime. Venus first of all appears like a
great lamp in the west. We have had simultaneously
other planets shining brightly, and particularly Jupiter,
Saturn, and Mars, the last two having been in the winter
of 1877-78 in close conjunction, but ruddy Mars not
being so full as we had at Interlachen seen it some months
before, when it was nearer the earth. The sky glows with
constellations, chief among which stands prominently out
Orion, which rises from the sea in the south-east, and
passes slowly and majestically over the firmament to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
north-west, every star in it, with generous but governed
emulation, stinting not its oil and burning with redoubled
energy. Then, almost right below Orion’s belt, Sirius, the
largest and most beautiful star visible from earth, radiates
in full intensity, shining and scintillating with a luminous
green splendour which has emanated from that grand orb
twenty-two years previously&mdash;a light so strong that it casts
a streak or tail across the Mediterranean like that of the
moon, though fainter and less. Then overhead are galaxies
of glory, in the midst of which the Milky Way, the nearest
of the nebulæ (for it is that to which we ourselves belong),
stretches over the great expanse its belt of pearly sheen,
the dwelling-place of countless myriads of starry habitants
whose light as now seen dates back to a period anterior to the
creation of man&mdash;all of them far too distant to be discernible
by the unassisted eye. Cold though the evenings sometimes
were, I was often tempted to turn out and see the matchless
sight. The promenade was close by, and there all was
open to the view.</p>

<p class="p2">Visitors, however, are no sooner settled in a place than,
according to immemorial usage, it seems to be their paramount
duty to escape out of it and see its environs, and
perhaps I shall best illustrate the locality by describing some
of our excursions.</p>

<p class="p2">Besides the main road which leads in one direction to
Monaco and Nice, and in the other to San Remo and
Genoa, and another road up the Carrei valley to Turin, and
roads which go a short way up the Boirigo and Gorbio
valleys, there is not much opportunity for varied driving;
but the mountains which connect themselves by their ridgy
tentacula with the very coast, afford innumerable excursions
on foot and on donkeys, and parties, often large in number,
are daily in good weather to be seen starting on such
expeditions. The donkeys are patient, sure-footed, know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
every inch of the way, and require little encouragement by
means of the whip. There are many roads or paths constructed
expressly for them up and over the ridges, although
rather intended for the rural traffic than for excursionizing.
The animals are let out for hire at 5 francs per day, or 2½
francs for the half day, the day being considered divided by
the lunch or dinner hour of twelve, and detention of half
an hour beyond twelve reckoned as a whole day. Girls or
boys, sometimes women or even men, attend the donkeys
and act as guides, expecting a trifle of a fee to themselves&mdash;generally
half a franc per donkey per day, and half that for
half a day. There are plenty of carriages of all kinds, but
principally light basket-carriages with one or more horses.
The only other mode of conveyance is the railway. Steamboats
do not touch at the port, and boating is not much
indulged in, the open sea not being particularly safe, although
near shore usually placid, and offering imposing views
towards the land.</p>

<p class="p2">A few days after our arrival, we joined a party of
friends for Castellar, which is about three miles distant. We
started after lunch, about half-past one, having six donkeys
for those who rode. It was the 2d of December, and the day
was overpoweringly hot. The ascent commences at once
from the town, and the mounting was almost continuous,
diversified, however, by stretches of level path. For protection
of the road, which would otherwise be soon worn
away, it is, like most other donkey paths, in its steeper parts
paved sometimes with the small round stones commonly
called petrified kidneys, which are very trying to the feet
of the walkers, at least till they get accustomed to them.
After we had gone up a short way, we obtained the shelter
of trees, which lessened the fatigue. It was a lovely walk
the whole way, the views at every turn being so fine; the sky
overhead, bright, clear, blue, against which the bold outlines
of the adjacent mountains broke in most picturesque lines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
while, whether we looked down the thickly-covered slopes
below or across the ravines to the wooded slopes of the
Berceau above, or to the hill ridges fringed with trees or
capped by picturesque buildings, it was a scene of grandeur
and beauty blended; while the silver-lined blue-green of the
olive leaf, mingling with the dark green of the pines, and
the grass and the wild shrubbery, combined with the bright
glitter of the sun through the branches to make it fairy-land.
Notwithstanding the shade afforded by the trees,
I felt the ascent very hot work, and perspired at every
pore. At last, in about an hour and a half, we reached
Castellar, perched upon the summit of the rock or acclivity,
which is 1200 feet above the level of the sea. We found
it a very curious old Italian village&mdash;a type, however, of
others which we subsequently saw. It consists of two long
narrow streets, and of three ranges of miserable old houses,
offering wretched uncomfortable holes for the inhabitants,
the wretchedness being probably to some extent redeemed
by the natural purity of the air. On the outside walls, the
windows, where they exist, stand high, and are small (in
many places merely loopholes for guns), the town being so
built as to afford some protection against the roving
expeditions of the Moors. Poor and miserable as the place
looks, it has, like all such villages, a grand church&mdash;that
is, grand in comparison with the dwellings and with the
apparent poverty of the people. The church is adorned by
the usual spire, which forms a feature of the little town or
village, which, though picturesque at a short distance, does
not afford as much scope for the pencil of the artist as some
other similar villages. From the platform on which the
town stands, we obtained a splendid view of the mountains
of Mentone and of the bay below. After halting a very
brief time, the party descended, to be back before sunset&mdash;a
precaution essentially needful to be attended to by those
who are subject to any weakness in the chest, and by no
means to be neglected even by those in robust health, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
just before sunset, and for an hour afterwards, a cold
clammy air descends or envelopes these regions. Going and
returning occupied altogether about three hours. We
returned highly satisfied with this our first expedition. On
the way down, the graceful towers of the churches at several
points came prominently into view.</p>

<p class="p2">After this hot day, we had two continuously wet days.
The rain poured heavily, the wind blew violently from
the south-west, and the torrent beds of the rivers were
filled to an extent I never saw subsequently. The rain
was no doubt very beneficial to a country which gets so
little, while the flood must have proved useful in clearing
out the bed of the river, with all its accumulations of dirt,
soapy washings, and olive refuse. As the stream in flood
brings down with it soil from the mountains, on this and
on other similar occasions, the rivers, by carrying out what
they hold in solution to the sea, discolour the water, and the
sea was a deeply-marked brown for a considerable distance
on and along the coast. The waves were high, and dashed
grandly on the shore, and broke beautifully over the pier.
Only on one occasion during this winter were they so
violent as to dash over the promenade. We were informed
it was a good sign that the winter should commence, as it
had done, with heavy rain, as it generally ensured a long
continuance of fine weather further on in the season. There
were a few wet days in November and December, and all
January and February we had it, nearly continuously, fine,
dry, and open. The clearness of the atmosphere of Mentone
is one of its great recommendations. There are no fogs such
as we have at home, though what seemed to be the mistral
produces an approach to them; but there are occasional cloudy
days, and when the sun gets behind a cloud, the air is cold,
sometimes keenly so. Wet days, however, are exceedingly
useful to the visitor for keeping up correspondence, which the
attractions out of doors tempt him to neglect in fine weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>During one of the days of the week upon which it did
not rain, I took a walk with a friend to the gorge of St.
Louis. The road was very muddy, in consequence of the
rain which had fallen; indeed, it is very seldom this road
is in an agreeable condition. It is laid with soft limestone,
which is ground down by heavy carts laden with
enormous stones which are being conveyed from the rocks
from which they are blasted to the breakwater. The dust
so formed lies about three inches deep upon the road.
Every horse, carriage, and cart which passes raises a
cloud; but when the wind blows, it becomes insufferable,
and there is hardly any possibility of brushing the dust
out of one’s clothes. Rain converts the dust into mud,
and when the mud has obtained a consistency by being
baked in the sun, it forms into hard ruts trying to the
pedestrian.</p>

<p>The gorge was fully two miles distant from our hotel,
and was a frequent point to which we subsequently walked
or drove. To reach it from the west end we may pass
through the Avenue Victor Emanuele, where the shops are,
and its continuation, the Rue St. Michael. The road then
skirts the water by the Quai Bonaparte (so called after
Napoleon <span class="smcap">I</span>., who constructed the Corniche road, of which
this is a part), and looking up, we saw the old town with
its ridge upon ridge of high old dingy houses, like so many
terraces one over the other&mdash;a very hanging garden (though
garden is anything but the suitable word) of old roofs and
chimney-tops; while, looking over the parapet wall, the water
lying 15 or 20 feet below, a fine view of the bay and little
harbour is had. But this part of the road is always under
shade after twelve o’clock, and is exceedingly trying to
invalids. I have often thought that the municipal authorities
might effect a vast improvement if they would construct
a diagonal road across from its commencement at
the well to the Hotel de la Paix. The water is very
shallow, apparently only a few feet deep; and though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
would be a work of time and would require much material,
it would really be of vast importance to Mentone, as then
the invalid could walk or drive either to or from the east
bay at any time of day without danger. The space intervening
between the embankment so to be formed and the
Quai Bonaparte, might afterwards be filled up and converted
into a large public garden. The operation, however, would
be costly, although the stone for forming it is at hand. But
taking things as they are, the road continues in front of the
various hotels I have already mentioned. Whether it was
that the air here is more confined than in the west bay, I
know not, but we never could walk along this long dusty
stretch without a feeling of languor such as was not experienced
in other and much longer walks, so that we were
always ready to take rest on one of the seats placed by the
roadside. After proceeding a good way, the road at the
east bend of the bay divides, and one fork winds up to the
gorge and on to Italy. The other fork turns aside into a
promenade (now in course of formation), as yet short, by
the margin of the sea and along the rocks of the coast,
which will, when completed, become, as even now to some
extent it is, a very agreeable accession to the amenity of
the east bay, where there are not so many nice walks as
are in the neighbourhood of the west bay. Reaching the
gorge, which forms a dividing ravine between the mountains
of the Berceau and Belinda, and is crossed by a bridge,
conspicuous from most parts of Mentone, standing about
200 feet above the stream below, and a good deal more
below the rocks towering above, we can at the north end
of the bridge place one foot in France and the other in
Italy. The Italian <i>douaniers</i> have a station-house a little
beyond, perched prominently on the summit of the rock.
The French <i>douaniers</i> have theirs on the road near to the
junction of the above-mentioned two roads, the two houses
being stationed considerably apart, as if to prevent the
possibility of quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The view from the bridge is remarkably fine, and should
be seen in the morning, as when the sun gets round to the
west or south-west, it throws much of the scene into the
shade, and is, besides, too dazzling to behold. The harbour
lies under us, a good mile off, with its few ships and boats,
and the picturesque old town; beyond it, the west bay,
Cape Martin, and all the panorama of mountains which
stretch to the north and north-west of Mentone, the aspect
of whose outlines and rugged tops, being so near, changes
at every different point of view.</p>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon of the same day, we took a walk up one
of the valleys. These valleys are all favourite walks to
those residing in the west bay. The views from the
bridges which span them at the mouths of the river or
rivers, supposed to run below them, are each different from
the other, and are exceedingly picturesque. The one next
to us was the Carrei or Turin valley. The torrent bed of
this river course is confined from its mouth, where it is
narrowed (speaking from recollection) to about 60 or 80
feet, and for a considerable way up and beyond the railway
viaduct, by sloping bulwarks of masonry. After this the
bed, no longer so confined, widens very considerably, and
about a mile from the mouth gets broad and bare; farther
up still, it narrows again, and becomes the rocky bed of
what sometimes may be called a river, but usually is
nothing but a small stream. Within Mentone the bed is
crossed by two wooden foot bridges, one wooden suspension
bridge for carriages and foot passengers, and a railway
viaduct. Looking up and northward from the wooden foot
bridge which spans the river course at its mouth, and placed
for the purpose of connecting two portions of the promenade,
one of the grandest views in Mentone is had.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> On either
side of the spectator the Eucalyptus and Spanish fig trees,
the flowering aloes and other trees of the public gardens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
offer a leafy inclosure; and carrying the eye along upon the
left side up the right bank of the Carrei to the railway
viaduct, and beyond it, we observe the tall plane trees of
the avenue leading to the railway station casting their
shadows over the road, and in the afternoon over the
river course, giving the aspect of agreeable shelter from
the sun. On the right side, like theatrical side scenes run
in one behind the other, bright-looking villas with their
coloured jalousies and red-tiled roofs, diversified by an
occasional one in blue lead and French roof, project out of
gardens,&mdash;the Hotel du Louvre and the Hotel des Îles
Britanniques, in the rear of all, being by a bend of the river
scarcely visible from this bridge. Then a mountain ridge
within half a mile from the bridge crosses the view above
1000 feet high, and crowned by a monastery (St. Annunciata),
and with slopes here concealed by olive, lemon, and
orange trees, in regular terraces, and there broken and exposed
by rock and steep earthy-looking sides, as if washed away,
and dotted elsewhere by coloured houses, and with straggling
pine trees bristling up from the immediate background; while
behind all this, as a grand back scene, rising boldly out of
rounded, verdant, or stony slopes, mingled and varying in
aspect each hour with the course of the sun, which throws
the shadows in the morning westward and the afternoon
eastward, and sometimes bathes them in light, and sometimes
veils them in shade, the rocky, rugged heights of the
mountains (seen here in part only), some of them only two to
three miles distant, tower up, thrown, in lines clear and strong,
upon the limpid blue sky tying cloudless and serene above.
The subject is one which frequently engages the pencil or
the brush of the amateur; but the situation is public, and one
cannot attempt a sketch without inviting inquisitive looks
by crowds of those who are too polite to stop and hang
over one’s head in heaps, like the wondering and intently
watchful, concerned, and admiring <i>gamins</i> of the street,
but who are rude enough sometimes to pass repeatedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
back and forward, shaking the bridge with every footfall,
and jostling each other and the artist for a look over the
shoulder as they pass. The scene is one which I never
could tire of beholding. It has been photographed, but
photographs never give a mountain view with the clearness
and effect of a good drawing.</p>

<p class="p2">But leaving the bridge and proceeding to the Avenue de
la Gare, we find on inquiry that this is the commencement
of the road to Turin, which is nearly 100 miles off, although
about half way it is met by a railway from Cuneo to
Turin, and is now all but superseded for traffic by the
coast railway towards Genoa, the direct line to Turin
branching off at Savona, making a distance by rail of about,
according to my calculation, 183 miles. This road is the
only one up the valleys which can be traversed for any
distance. A strong current of air frequently blows down
the valley and renders it occasionally in its shady parts a
cold walk for the invalid, who must in winter months carry
wraps for use when either he gets out of sunshine or the
sun retires behind a cloud. This current is, I presume,
the cause of the west bay being cooler than the east. It
is, however, a charming walk up the road, level for nearly
two miles, and the greater part of the way&mdash;indeed, almost
the whole of it&mdash;being fringed with trees. For a little
distance after passing under the railway viaduct, pretty
houses, in gardens full of orange and lemon trees covered
with fruit, are seen on both sides of the river; and in spring,
women are constantly met bearing on their heads to town
immense basketfuls of lemons and oranges. Farther on, and
on emerging from the shade of the monastery hill, a curious
range of oil-mills has been placed like steps one over the
other on the slope of the hill, driven each by a separate
water wheel of large diameter&mdash;the same water, apparently,
by an economical arrangement, driving the wheels successively
as it falls. Some way beyond these mills, the
road begins to ascend and to wind, and, as the valley closes
in, thickly planted with trees on both sides, seems to become
more and more inviting; while peeps are had of Castellar,
high overhead, on the right, embosomed among olive groves.
Rocky mountains, bold and bluff, oppose themselves nearer
and nearer to the spectator; the small village of Monti and
its white church and long spire is attained, and after some
miles by a zig-zag road, the summit, upwards of 2000 feet
high, and three miles from the sea, is won. An excellent
excursion by carriage along this road is to the picturesque
village of Sospello, 22 kilometres, or about 14 miles distant
from Mentone, passing and visiting by the way the curious
old town of Castiglione, which lies perched up among the
mountains (inaccessible by carriage) at a height, it is said,
of over 2500 feet above the sea.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The valley of Carrei, partly from its proximity to our
hotel, was with us a favourite walk, and could be visited
also by a more sunny road for a short way on the east
bank of the river course. Here, as elsewhere, the
municipality have placed wooden seats, which are very
acceptable to pedestrians. Sometimes a whiff of cold air
blowing down the valley proves too trying to allow of
sitting long; but one scarcely tires of the bright glad sun,
or the view of the hill slopes and verdure with which they
are covered all the year through, or of the bold mountains,
on the foremost central one of which may be discovered&mdash;particularly
with the aid of a glass, for it is at first hardly
distinguishable by the eye from the rocks on which it
rests&mdash;the ruined castle of Ste. Agnese, elevated like an
eagle’s eyrie high up on the apparently inaccessible summit.</p>

<p class="p2">A trip to Ste. Agnese is generally taken by all who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
not infirm. Though not so arduous as the ascent of the
Berceau, of the Grand Mont, or of Mont Agel, which all
command extensive views, but can only be undertaken by
the able-bodied, it is a somewhat fatiguing excursion, and
most people perform the ascent on donkey back. On the
13th December, the morning and day being fine, we started,
a party of twelve, with eight donkeys and two donkey-drivers.
To reach the point from which the ascent begins,
we proceeded along the Nice road westward to the Boirigo
valley. The view from the bridge across this valley was
then (even still is, notwithstanding the erection of buildings
on each side, some of them lofty and uninteresting, has
somewhat contracted the view) much more open and extensive
than that from the Carrei bridge. It took in west,
north, and east, the whole panorama of mountain, twenty-eight
peaks and pinnacles, enumerated in Giordan’s little
<i>Mentone Guide</i> (1877), being counted from the bridge.
A road runs up each side of the river course, which is
hemmed in like the Carrei by bulwarks of masonry. The
road upon the left bank does not proceed above a mile, when&mdash;at
a picturesquely-situated olive-oil mill, embosomed
among olive and lemon trees, and bordered by a pretty
stretch of the channel of the river, lying at the bottom of a
dell closed in by wooded hills on both sides&mdash;it is shut in
and becomes a donkey path buried among the trees of the
valley, the river in the ravine below meantime narrowing
correspondingly. The walk by this delightful path through
the woods arrives at an old stone bridge leading to the
village of Cabriole, whence by a steep ascent Ste. Agnese may
be taken. The road upon the right bank terminates more
speedily, entering at a large pottery upon ‘the primrose
valley,’ the river course of which, delightfully shut in by
high banks, is usually all but dry. Up both valleys we have
had many pleasant strolls. On the present occasion, proceeding
only a short way beyond the railway viaduct, we left
the last-mentioned road, and, ascending by a steep donkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
path, gradually gained the top of a ridge, along which, at a
gradient gently inclining upward, a walk lies, protected, like
that to Castellar, by trees, and looking down on the Gorbio
valley&mdash;on the one side, its great plain thickly planted
with olive trees, and terminated at its north end by the
town of Gorbio, as if resting on an island peak; and on
the other, on the Boirigo valley and the monastery heights.
It took us some time to reach the base of the mountains,
when the path became rough with loose stones, and steep
and toilsome. Nearly three hours elapsed from the time
of our leaving the hotel till we reached one of the mountain
roadside chapels, with which the country abounds, constructed
not only to point religious feelings, but as covered
places of refuge from a storm. As usual, a cross stood by
it, bent to the north-east, indicating that south-west were
the violent and prevailing winds. This chapel, which
could easily have held all our party and more in a storm,
was a short way below the town of Ste. Agnese, and afforded
a convenient resting-place ere proceeding farther. We had
from it a good view of Ste. Agnese, which, being placed
back on the north side of the mountain, is not visible from
Mentone. It stands about 2100 or 2200 feet above the
level of the sea. The castle, now in ruins, on the summit,
is above 300 feet higher. As a stronghold it was no doubt
almost unassailable; for on one side the rock may be said to
be perpendicular, and the other sides are, as I learnt from
the ascent, very steep. The town of Ste. Agnese, which we
had yet a good pull to arrive at, is another of those curious
villages which are seen in the Riviera. From a little
distance it has a deserted, ruinous look, and the place does
not improve upon nearer acquaintance. Of course, notwithstanding
the apparent poverty of the inhabitants, it
has a grand church with a spire to it, and we had chanced
to light upon a fête day; for, as we were sitting on the
rocks beyond it at lunch (brought with us as usual on such
excursions, and forming no unacceptable part of their enjoyment),<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
we cast our eyes down upon the steep hillside
below, and there we saw winding up, quite a number of
priests and people with images, banners, and other insignia.
On reaching the plateau on which we were, they halted to
rest, and then formed into procession, one priest bearing in
front a large crucifix with a figure of our Saviour on it,
life-size; and all chanting, proceeded to the church.</p>

<p>Resting some time, a few of us ventured to climb to the
castle. An interesting legend (fully narrated in Pemberton’s
<i>Monaco</i>, p. 351) attaches to it. During the latter half of
the tenth century, Haroun, a bold African chief, in command
of a formidable fleet, was cruelly ravaging the coast and
carrying off captives, among whom was a maiden of Provence
called Anna, of illustrious birth and marvellous beauty.
The vessel bearing her to Spain had been taken after a
bloody battle, in which her father and two brothers were
killed. Haroun had first pitied and protected her, and then
fell violently in love with her. His jealous wife, divining
the fact from his altered demeanour, gave orders to bind her
and have her by night cast into the sea. Discovering this
in time, he saved Anna’s life, and in his rage caused his
wife to be strangled. Arriving opposite Ste. Agnese, and
struck by the advantage of the position, he landed with
100 men and his captives, the natives flying before him,
ascended the mountain, and built the fort. Here he importuned
the disconsolate maid to renounce Christianity
and marry him, but in vain; till, finding her one day praying
for him, he was overcome, embraced Christianity himself,
and fled with her and all his treasure to Marseilles, where
they were joyfully received and were married.</p>

<p>The return took rather shorter time than the ascent; but
the expedition occupied nearly the whole day from breakfast-time
till dark. We might have descended by two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
different routes, but chose the way by which we had come.
One of the other routes would have been by going round
the mountain and descending upon the east side; but I
believe it is very steep, and not much approved by the
guides or donkey people. Another route would have been
by diverging from the road by which we had ascended and
coming down another ridge, called the Arbutus Walk (from
the circumstance that it is filled with arbutus trees, with
their brilliant scarlet and gold flower and fruit, so tempting
and attractive to young people), and terminating in the
Madonna Hill, a very favourite walk from Mentone. All in
the hotel who had not taken part were eager to hear about
our expedition, and we became for the nonce heroes, as
famous as if we had made the ascent of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p class="p2">If one were to ascend simply to obtain a view, that from
Ste. Agnese, or even from the castle on the top, would
scarcely repay the fatigue of the ascent. It is dominated
by a chain of rocky mountains, which surround it on every
side except that to the sea; and the view towards the sea&mdash;that
is, towards Mentone&mdash;is not more extensive than
what may be obtained from many lower points upon which
we there look down, and among others the monastery of
Annunciata, which seems a long way immediately below,
although it stands high, and is a prominent object from
Mentone.</p>

<p>To this monastery we paid several visits. It stands on
the ridge between the Carrei and Boirigo valleys, and is
said at one time&mdash;by no means, looking to its position,
unlikely&mdash;to have been the former site of Mentone and of
a castle. The plateau on which now the chapel and
monastery are built is above 1000 feet high, and is attained
by another of those donkey paths of which there are so
many on the hills. In fact, various such paths, more or less
steep, conduct up to it from different parts. The main
ascent from the Carrei valley is sharp and steep enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and has the usual allowance of twelve or fifteen chapels
or stations by the way&mdash;little places like sentry-boxes, in
which sometimes objects of worship are placed. A small
church or chapel forms an adjunct to the monastery. Its
walls are covered over with votive pictures in commemoration
of miraculous escapes from great dangers, but of the
rudest description. They depict the danger escaped, and the
Virgin opportunely appearing in the clouds to interpose and
save, and are very singular specimens of art, drawn by the
merest tyros&mdash;or rather babes&mdash;in art. It is surprising how
those in charge of the church could allow it to be desecrated
by such trashy attempts at the pictorial. The thing, however,
is to be seen in many other such churches. Our first
visit to this spot was at Christmas-time (29th Dec.), when
the monks dress up a little crypt below the chapel in a very
curious way, so as to represent the Nativity of our Lord.
On a raised platform a country-side is seen, with rocks, and
plains, and rustic bridges, studded over by little puppet
figures or dolls about a foot high, others in the distance
smaller, personating different characters&mdash;kings, Roman
soldiers, shepherds with some woolly sheep, and Joseph and
Mary standing in the midst of all. Near them a little babe
lies on the ground, and kneeling before and adoring it a
figure, I suppose, representing one of the Magi. Nor are
angels wanting to complete the representation; while in a
recess in the distant vista a toy Noah’s Ark is set, supposed
to be resting on Ararat, satisfactorily proving by ocular
demonstration that Noah’s Ark was, at the time of the
Nativity, visible. The figures are evidently carved, by the
hands of the monks, as the faces differ entirely from those
of ordinary dolls, and from each other. It must cost the
monks a good deal of labour to make the arrangements; but
they have, I presume, little else to do, and it no doubt
furnishes an agreeable occupation, which doubtless they
grievously want. At stated hours of the day they may be
heard with sepulchral voices chanting service; and as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
seem to have nothing else to do, I suppose it may literally
be said their vocation is, ‘<i>Vox et preterea nihil</i>.’</p>

<p class="p2">The most westerly of the valleys is that of Gorbio, which
in some respects is the most beautiful, as it is the most
secluded of all the three. It has no broad torrent bed
like those of the Carrei and Boirigo, and in fact the river
can scarcely be seen between its entrance to the sea and
a long way up the valley, the road between these points
lying at some distance from the river, in a ravine below,
winding its course over rocks and among trees which hide
it from sight. The valley, everywhere wooded, and river
derive their name from the town of Gorbio, which crests
a lofty conical-shaped rock or height 1400 feet high, about
three miles distant from Mentone. The olive-covered ridges
rise also on either side the valley pretty steeply, and hem it in.</p>

<p>On 14th February a party was made up from our hotel
to go to Gorbio, sixteen in number, with nine donkeys and
three donkey attendants. We left at half-past nine in the
morning and got back at five o’clock. There is now a good
carriage road for a considerable distance up the valley; but
at that time it was only in course of formation, and was
very rough. Where the road ceases, the ascent, hitherto
gentle, becomes more perceptible; and on arriving at a point
below the height on which Gorbio stands, we had to look
up to it far above on the summit of its bold abrupt rock.
It looked magnificent, and the sketchers of the party longed
exceedingly to take it from that point; but the donkeys, or
their drivers or riders, had no compassion, and, as it was not
desirable to separate on such excursions, the chance on this
occasion was lost, though, by starting a little earlier than
the party, I got it on a subsequent visit.</p>

<p>The ascent to the top was steep by a donkey path, but
the town was very curious. It has been, I believe, the scene
of many battles. After inspecting it amidst the gazing of
a crowd of idle inhabitants, we adjourned to a grassy bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a little outside, where we enjoyed our lunch, and the four
sketchers were recompensed by obtaining a view of the town
from an excellent point. As Gorbio is an excursion
frequently made, we were surrounded by children, who kept
us in a state of siege for coppers, which they are led by the
injudiciousness of visitors to expect, and it was no easy
matter to shake them off. We had still a great deal before
us to do; so, as soon, as possible, the donkeys were remounted,
and we proceeded along a mountain path, gradually reaching
an elevation several hundred feet above Gorbio, on which
we then looked down. All along this path we had splendid
views, including one of the village of Ste. Agnese and the
mountain on which it stands, which, from that point presenting
its edge to us, appeared like a sharp Swiss aiguille.
After a long circuit, we reached a point, at which the party
dismounted and walked to the top of a hill commanding the
valley; and then began the descent by a rough, stony,
mountainous path to Rochebrune, about two miles off.
Some of our party, keeping too high up, had to descend the
mountain so perpendicularly that they could only liken the
declivity to the side or face of a house.</p>

<p>Rochebrune rests upon the slope of a hill looking westward,
down upon the Corniche road, on Monaco and the
sea, between 600 and 800 feet below. The ruins of a
castle stand upon a rock, which is said to have slipped
down from a cliff 200 or 300 feet above. This, if true,
would be a remarkable and unique circumstance. The town
itself, which is about three or four miles from Mentone,
from which it is a favourite excursion, is very picturesque,
and affords many choice bits for the artist, I think more so
than any similar town in the neighbourhood. One of our
party jocularly proposed to come and spend a fortnight there,
and take sketches; but to any civilised person it would be
just as agreeable to spend the time, if that were possible, in
a rabbit warren, to which another compared it. The view
towards Monaco and the hills beyond it is very fine, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
requires to be seen before the afternoon sun comes round.
There are two ways of reaching Mentone from Rochebrune&mdash;one,
by going down to the Corniche road a little below; and
the other, by descending through terraces of fine old olive
trees, one of which, in the pathway leading out of the
village, is of immense girth, and must be of great age. It
is said that some of the olive trees in this neighbourhood
are considered to be nearly two thousand years old. The
trunks of these olives are often very curious, from the
mode in which they divide or split up and twist about. By
either way to Mentone, splendid views are obtained, and the
usual course on an excursion to Rochebrune is to go by one
route and return by the other. In going by the road, we
skirt the tongue of land called Cape Martin.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most interesting and most usual walks or
drives from Mentone is to this Cape Martin&mdash;to the point
it is above two miles distant; and it is at present, or was
while we were there, reached either by the rough, stony
beach, disagreeable for the feet, but the shorter way, and
pleasant, as passing by the ocean and having the view open
to the scenes around. In time, it is expected that the
promenade will be extended all along the coast to the cape,
which will make approach to it by the shore a most agreeable
walk. The other access, much longer, is by proceeding
along the dusty high road leading to Monaco to some distance
beyond the Hôtel? du Pavillon, and passing under a
railway viaduct which crosses the road to a rough side
road or avenue which diverges to the left and winds
through a delicious plantation of fine old olive trees, with
knotted, and gnarled, and divided trunks, and long, vigorous
branches which stretch fantastically overhead and interlace;
while the sun glinting through them here casts alternate
lights and shadows on the white limestone road, and there
shoots in streaks through the openings, speckling the forest
with glancing radiance, shifting and changing as the olive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
boughs wave, and their tender leaves turning now their
silver breasts and now their green backs to the breeze,
shimmer in the light; while the carpet of grass is spread
underneath, dotted over with violet and anemone; and the
distance is dark, shut out by the thicket of trees, and the
background of shrubs, and banks, and hill. As the road
proceeds, it again passes under another railway bridge, the
trains over which whistle and whirl on, scaring the passers-by,
and breaking incongruously on the quiet of the scene,
as if winged demons had escaped and in a state of fright
rushed in hot and fiery to disturb the tranquillity of the
land and break its peace. Then walled gardens are passed,
closely planted with orange trees, laden in bunches with
their tempting fruit. Still keeping on this rustic road
amidst more olive trees, we at last arrive upon an open part,
and behold a church of curious design on the one hand, and
the blue Mediterranean on the other, and before us the
avenue along the margin of the promontory. Here it had
unhappily been intended to have built a town, and as a
commencement three villas have been erected; but the
situation is not only too distant from Mentone, but is on
the wrong side of the hill, seeing the sun leaves it in cold
shade soon after noon; and thus, though commanding a
splendid view all along the coast eastward, they have not
found favour, and stand silent and all but deserted. Beyond
these villas, and at the entrance to the wooded hill, the
carcass of an unfinished Roman arch, intended no doubt as
a grand portal to the projected new town, spans the road,
which, proceeding by the border of the promontory, and overhanging
it, looks down through the trees and rocks to the
lovely sea sporting about in little pools, or surging and
breaking on its natural bulwarks, while the slopes of the
hill above on the right hand side are densely overspread with
wood. At the end of the avenue, where the shelter of the
hill terminates, the strength and usual lie of the wind are
manifested in the bent and twisted forms of the trees, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of which are inclined, curved, or in some cases doubled
down, as if bowing in lowly obeisance towards Mentone in
the north-east, the south-west winds blowing fiercely across
the ocean when they come. The walks through the forest
and up to the semaphore on the top are charming, and
make Cape Martin one of the most enjoyable of the easy
excursions from Mentone, so that the visitors have great
cause to congratulate themselves that the building speculation
came to nought. If building be ever resumed, it is to
be hoped the forest will be spared to the public, and that
any houses will be placed on the west or sunny side;
although it would be a mistake there too, as it is wholly
without shelter from the west. It is not unusual for large
parties to come to picnic in the woods and enjoy the scene,
bringing their lunch with them. Some houses were commenced
on a level plateau at the point, one of them
suspiciously like an incipient restaurant, but, no doubt,
being found to be too much exposed, were abandoned, and
what little was put up is now going to wreck and ruin. It
is to be hoped that Cape Martin will never be desecrated
by any such concern in the future. Here, at and round the
point, the land is surrounded by a belting of rocks and
sharp pinnacles, worn so by the breaking of the waves, and
upon these pinnacles the sea is continually breaking. In
stormy weather, it is beautiful to observe the waves rolling
in and striking the rocks with great violence, and dashing
high into the air, shivering into millions of shining particles,
forming spray, which spreads and scatters in brilliant
showers all round. Nor is it less beautiful, when the breeze
is gentle, to watch the waves rolling majestically in, the
hot sun shining through the long well-dressed line as if it were
through purest glass of the brightest sea-green, and then to
observe the rearing crests tumbling grandly over as they charge
to the death and deliver themselves one after another on the
rocky beach, which with a calm steadiness receives the shock.</p>

<p>From Cape Martin fine views are had of Monte Carlo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Monaco, with the more distant Antibes, and even the
Estrelles; while north-eastward, as if in long white robes,
the young Mentone lies nestling or cradled in at the foot
of the high range of mountains which, like gigantic Titans,
in mute serenity hang over, and watch and guard with
placid pride the smiling, sleepy little town to which they
have given birth. With scenery so romantic, the point of
the cape has become a very favourite haunt of the artist.
It is seldom a visit is paid to it in which, if the weather be
fine (for in cold weather one cannot sit long), persons are
not to be seen taking sketches or elaborating more finished
pictures, for which a capital foreground is furnished by the
bent and distorted trees.</p>

<p class="p2">But it would be endless to describe or even to enumerate
all the many walks and excursions which are possible from
Mentone. These are principally from the western side;
but we had occasionally walks in the other direction. I
have already mentioned the walk to the gorge of St. Louis.
There is another walk which we sometimes had to the rocks
below and beyond the gorge, called ‘Les Rochers rouges’
from their red colour. These derive a peculiar interest
from their containing certain caves or fissures in the rock,
disclosed or opened up by the formation of the railway, out
of one of which was exhumed the skeleton, or what is called
the fossil skeleton, of a man. This, of course, is held up
as evidencing the existence of man anterior to the creation
of Adam, by those who believe in the existence of Preadamites.
The skeleton is in Paris, and I have seen neither
it nor the <i>brochure</i> of Dr. Rivière describing the discovery;
but I noticed that the sides of the cave&mdash;as it at present
stands, after the excavations for the railway&mdash;are not more
than 20 feet apart at the bottom, the cave extending probably
40 feet inward, and about 50 or 60 feet high; but
these eye measurements are sometimes deceptive. It is of
very soft limestone, and in other parts of the rocks there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
are huge stalactites depending. It may therefore be very
safely said that stalactite would at an early period form
with great rapidity, and speedily cover up what the cave
contained. I was informed, however, that the skeleton was
found about 9 feet below the surface, in the midst of debris.
In these caves, and elsewhere round about, many flint
implements have been found, and some of them are collected
in the Natural History Museum in the Hotel de Ville at
Mentone. The workmen finding them sell them to
strangers for a few pence.</p>

<p>Dr. Bennet’s and Mr. Hanbury’s gardens both lie in this
direction&mdash;Dr. Bennet’s, on the rocks above the Italian
<i>douane</i> station; Mr. Hanbury’s, about a mile and a half
farther on the road to Ventimiglia. They may properly be
called hanging gardens, and are not laid out as gardens are
with ourselves. Many tropical plants are growing in them
in the open air.</p>

<p class="p2">Our best excursion in this direction was that to the top
of Belinda. We started on 31st January 1877, a party of
eleven, with six donkeys. The walkers drove to Pont St.
Louis, where they were overtaken by those on donkeys.
All then proceeded a little beyond the bridge and the
station of the Italian <i>douane</i>, and ascended by very steep paths
to the village of Grimaldi, about 700 feet above the sea, on
the slope or shoulder of Belinda, and seen from Mentone
picturesquely buried among the olive trees. This is
another of those curious old towns with the usual appendage
of a church and spire. The slope on which it is built is
all but perpendicular, so that house rises over house, and
the back base of a house is greatly higher than the front.
Clovelly in North Devon is nothing to it. Roads are impossibilities.
There are no streets, only narrow paths, or at
best donkey tracks, through it. By one of these paths,
winding upward, we were led to a point right above the
gorge of St. Louis. From this dizzy height, the party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
halting, looked down upon the precipitous yawning gulf
below, and then across the bay towards Mentone, and upward
towards the mountains, which this new position threw
into shapes different from any observable from other points.
Having taken in this striking view, we are urged to proceed
by a very rough path, some parts of which are so uncommonly
steep that those riding were compelled to dismount
from their donkeys, and manage the ascent, like the others,
as best they could; and so, alternately scrambling up pretty
nearly perpendicular parts, and alternately winding up and
jogging on by gentle ascents, where the donkeys were
remounted, and through a forest of young trees, we, in about
two hours and a half from the time of leaving the hotel,
inclusive of a halt of half an hour at Grimaldi, attained
the top of Belinda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>This mountain is, as already stated, 1702 feet high, and
the view from the top of it is very extensive. We fancied
we saw westward along the French coast, beyond the
Estrelles, as far as the Îles d’Or off Hyères. If so, this
would be a distance of fully ninety miles. On the east side,
we could not see along the Italian coast beyond Bordighera,
as the mountains rise and shut out further view in that
direction. The huge rocky Berceau towered up in close
proximity, to the north; and behind it, away to the eastward,
we saw the tops of the snowy Maritime Alps peering
up in magnificent white drapery; while between them and
the coast lay a peculiar species of high, barren, bleak,
desolate-looking mountains, intersected by wild and bare
river courses; and more immediately below us, portions of
the ramparts of Ventimiglia; and beyond, the long arm of
Bordighera, appearing, from this point of view, stunted and
different from its aspect at Mentone. The wind was
blowing piercingly cold from the north-east at the top, so
that we could not gaze at the scene in this direction above
a few minutes; but just below the top, on the western slope,
we found shelter and sun warmth, and enjoyed our lunch
and the splendid prospect. On returning, we descended by
a different path, which in many parts might well be termed
a <i>mauvais pas</i>. It was often so bad and so precipitous
that the riders, in dread of their necks, were soon obliged
to leave their saddles and walk. At last we reached the
Corniche road, near to Mr. Hanbury’s garden, and by this
road returned home. From the heights we had seen a
cloud of dust hanging over the road to Mentone, in consequence
of the wind having risen to a gale. We now
were under the necessity of encountering this dust, and,
barring the chill blast on the hill-top, it formed the only
obstacle to a thorough enjoyment of this most delightful
excursion, which occupied altogether between seven and
eight hours.</p>

<p class="p2">Although Mentone thus possesses so many walks and
excursions in its neighbourhood, of which only a few have
been touched upon, there are some people who, going there,
fancy that it is an unattractive place. The fact is, that
these people do nothing but walk up and down the
promenade, perhaps also proceeding a short way up one or
two of the valleys, and in all likelihood never even so much
as venturing through the obstructions to the pier or the
breakwater wall in course of formation, and now extending
some length, from which one of the best views of the
mountain range is to be had. It may be imagined, therefore,
that a monotonous perambulation up and down the
same road, however attractive in itself, may in time become
tiresome, even if we put out of consideration those numerous
dullards upon whom fine scenery or the charms of nature
are altogether lost. In reality, however, it is one of the
most captivating promenades to be found anywhere; and I
always felt it to be in itself a very cheerful scene, whether
when gay with its moving crowds in a morning, or when in
the quiet repose of still life. But although preferring a
quieter time, it is when thronged and all ‘the world’ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Mentone is there that seemingly to most people it is most
inviting; and between the hours of 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and 12, the
Promenade du Midi is alive with promenaders, for the
earlier part of the day is considered to be the best period
for so walking. Twelve o’clock is the general lunch or
early dinner hour, and after that, or even before, the wind
sometimes rises; but before 12, it is usually warm&mdash;nay,
hot; and many men as well as women walk out with white
parasols (lined with green), and many with blue goggle
spectacles, to protect their precious eyes from the white
glitter of the road. Although the glistering blaze of the
sun upon the water, if caught direct, is too dazzling to abide,
I never personally found either the heat or the general
glare so oppressive as to require these protections, and it
rather appeared to me that it was beneficial to accustom
the eyes to the light. On certain days a band of music
plays in the gardens in the afternoon (at other times playing
at the <i>cirque</i>, or at the new gardens at the East End), but
we seldom heard it, except by accident, as we devoted the
afternoon to more distant walks. To some people, however,
the music was evidently an unfailing attraction, although,
so far as I could judge, the audiences were mainly confined
to French and Germans, and other continentals, who, with
some excellent exceptions, never seem to have any enjoyment
beyond occasionally a little light reading, a good deal
of idle smoking, or an endless elaborate thrumming on
pianos, and on whom, therefore, time hangs heavily. English
people, women especially, have generally an occupation of
some kind. In reading, writing, sketching, and other occupations,
I was never myself without employment, and
sometimes was pressed enough for time.</p>

<p class="p2">On the promenade one sees a good deal of the peculiarities
of the different countries represented in Mentone,
especially in the matter of dress; and on this account, if for
no other reason, it affords opportunities for observation not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
without their interest. Let us take a walk. It is, we
shall suppose, the 21st December, the shortest day, cold
and shivery in the north, and verging to eleven o’clock of
the forenoon. The fishing operations of the morning are
over, and the boats engaged in it have been drawn up upon
the beach. The water carts, small wooden boxes drawn by
men, have performed their rounds, and the roadway is moist,
but is rapidly drying up under the burning beams of the
hot sun; but the dust is laid. The sea is tranquil&mdash;not a
ripple disturbs it, except at the very edge, where it lazily
turns over in the tiniest of waves, as if the exertion implied
far too much fatigue for this melting day. A ship has
ventured out of the harbour, spreading its white sails in
vain attempt to catch a breeze. A flock of gulls are resting,
in quiet happiness and contemplation, their snowy bosoms
on the glassy water. In the distance, bright Bordighera is
stretching its long green sleeve far into the blue sea, its
fair hand lighted by the sun; while its cathedral window,
like a jewel on the finger, catches and glistens with a blazing
ray. Nearer, the fortifications of Ventimiglia are peering
round from behind a jutting hill. Belinda, high and verdant;
the gorge of St. Louis, deep in the shade; and the lofty
Berceau, just emerging into the solar beams, fill up the near
background, against which is cast the pier, terminated by
its old castle, and half concealing the little sheaf of masts
which it girdles, and bounded landward by a line of tall
picturesque old buildings, out of and above which the
minarets of the town churches gracefully rise. Then down
along the promenade, on the one side, rests the irregular
and diversified line of hotels and houses and gardens, partly
filled with low trees, refreshing to the sight; while a low,
scrubby, ill-kept belt of evergreens, dusty and withered,
strives at some parts to guard the frontier on the other side
against a careless tumble down the bulwarks bordering the
beach; and all along this level road, common to man and
to beast (for there is no footway), a crowd of people is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
streaming. In the view of so much that is grand in nature,
we are at first hardly conscious of the concourse. We
begin to move down the promenade,&mdash;’cric-crac,’&mdash;turn the
shoulder suddenly, and find a <i>voiture</i> has almost run us
down. Neither man nor horse apologizes. They pass on
unheeding our well-merited indignation; and, as we cast
a fierce look and waste an English word, down comes
another at full speed with angry ‘crack, crack.’ Glad, like
others, to jump unscathed away, we are about to sit down
upon one of the many wooden seats or forms which the
providence of Mentone has placed here and there to lessen
the lassitude of the human frame. In the very nick of
time we luckily discover a warning label, and are thankful
we have not become for the day men of mark; for the
bright green seat, so delightfully clean and pretty and enticing,
has just been repainted. We look out for another,
for the sun is hot, and our limbs are getting jaded, and
fortunately detect one to which the attention of the
municipal adorners of Mentone has not as yet been directed.</p>

<p>And now pass in review before us all the inhabitants&mdash;no,
not all the inhabitants, but a considerable section of
the visitors, intermingled with a few of the residents of
this remarkable place. Here comes a short Cockney,
broiling in a long Noah’s Ark Ulster&mdash;the young man has
no other upper coat, and, besides, it adds a span to his
stature. Then follow him in a row, three or four tall,
lanky young Dutchmen in their dapper little coatees.
Then a party of German ladies, plump in figure and
peculiar in their body-gear and head-dress, their good looks
set off by a most comfortable-looking ruff or frill about
the neck. They are accompanied by a fair German gentleman
in gold spectacles. As they pass, their ‘Yahs’ and
their ‘Achs’ betray their origin. Close after saunters
along a pleasant-looking clergyman, who, far from official
cares, wisely doffs official costume, and is accompanied by
two blooming English daughters. Near to him follows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
meditatively a priest without daughters, whose bluish-black
cheeks and chin disclose it to be three days off from
last shaving night. Now we must feel nervous and think
and shake about our misdeeds, for who should follow in the
full dignity of office but an imposing gendarme with fierce
moustache, and in cocked hat and hot blue cloth clothing,
adorned by yards of twisted cord, and swinging a murderous
sword by his side. The little boys could see him a mile
off. We breathe more freely when he is past&mdash;this
terrible man of office. But nothing afraid, three women
of Mentone are close upon his heels, perhaps in gaping
admiration. Two of them bear on their heads each a large
basket of dirty clothes they are taking to some dirty pool
to wash. The third leads a child, and wears a broad
Mentone flat hat, 16 inches wide at the very least. All
are sturdy, and their carriage is erect. The little child
wears a red hood, which tightly fits the round bullet head,
and descends upon the neck and shoulders. The women
wear short woollen jackets reaching to the waist, their
lower drapery decently short. Another woman is behind,
dressed similarly, except that, instead of hat, she, in common
with most other native women, ties a coloured handkerchief
round her head, and thus with a presumable thickness of
bone beneath becomes proof against solar heat. Then
succeed rows or groups of unmistakeable English in all
varieties of home costume, suitable or unsuitable, though
occasionally a damsel will glory in French attire, possibly
a little Anglified. Then other groups of equally unmistakeable
French. Here and there a solitary Frenchman
steps out in full Parisian costume, with trig kid gloves,
high chimney-pot hat, and smart cane or white parasol.
And now and then a pale-looking young man, tended by an
anxious sister or still more anxious mother, walks slowly
past. He has come too late to obtain good. Had he
come a year sooner, he might ere this, had it been the
Divine will, have regained his strength. All health resorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
abound with clergymen, particularly English and Scotch
clergy&mdash;men of all denominations, whose ministerial exertions
seem to necessitate occasional ‘retreats.’ Mentone
is a favourite gathering-place for them. Here comes one,
with a broad, low-crowned wide-awake (clerical undress),
with white choker and lengthy surtout, his round face red
and jovial, and beaming with laughing jollity; and alongside
of him stalks a younger man of a sad and sallow
countenance, whose greater length of coat proves more veritable
descent from the apostles. He has just arrived from
London, and is on his route to the great city of the Italian
king&mdash;perhaps hopes to have a secret meeting with the
Pope. ‘I can’t linger here,’ he says; ‘I am on my way
to Rome.’ ‘Ay,’ replies the older one, ‘so I see. I am
content to remain here; half way, you know&mdash;ha! ha!’
They stop a moment, shake hands, and as the younger one
turns carelessly to go, he nearly upsets an old fisherman
with a coil of ropes in his hand, a pending striped cowl
on his head, and clothed in a short wrought woollen coat and
indescribable trousers, patched, like the famous Delphian
Boat, till no trace of the original remains. One trouser leg
is down, the other is drawn to the top, and discloses a long,
bare, dirty-looking, unwashed, hairy leg. The feet are shoeless,
the body spare, and the face pinched, as if he saw more
work than victuals, and browned, as if he handled more
fish than <i>savon</i>&mdash;in all likelihood the very personification
of the fisherman of Cæsar’s time. And now a nursery-maid
with three lively little English children toddle along,
the young ones attired in Mentone hats of narrow diameter,
prettily decorated in worsted, but rather difficult articles to
attach to the head. Fortunately the wind does not blow.
And now jauntily trot up two riders&mdash;a young Englishman
on a milk-white steed and lady on a chestnut. They are off
for a canter along the road to Cape Martin. And then, as if
in mockery, immediately follow an ass with panniers, in each
of which will be found planted a fat, chubby, small child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
looking dreamily contented or ignorantly happy, attended
by donkey-driver, pleased attentive nurse, proud mother,
and a big little brother with toy whip in hand astride
another donkey. But here walks up an old friend, a
divinity professor, presumably of the Broad Church; for is
not the brim of his wide-awake broad enough to drive a
coach and four round it? We must rise and shake hands,
the more especially as we see stealthily approaching the
lean painter, casting hungry looks at the seat, as much as
to say, ‘By your leave;’ and feeling really desirous of
being regarded blacker than we might be painted, we quit,
join our friend, and move on. All this time we have been
revolving the peculiarities of French female attire; for,
generally speaking, we could tell a French woman by her
long sack-like cloak. According to the fashion then prevailing,
which may most likely be now changed, this sack
hung down from the shoulders, tapering outwards as it
descended to the bottom without any waist; for it seems
to be the practice of the French for the men all to dress
so as to give them the appearance of a wasp-like waist, and
for the women all to dress as if waist they had none. Nor
can I say, having had no opportunities of knowing, unless
in observing the specimens of Mentone women walking
about, whose conformation, unaltered by dress, is striking,
and apt to convey this idea, being broad at the shoulders,
broader still at the waist, and broadest at the haunches.
Then all the French ladies, in defiance of surgical laws,
wear high heels upon their shoes&mdash;sometimes no less than
three inches high; and perhaps I am not far wrong in
saying that, with few exceptions, every one of them in
consequence walks badly, with a short hobbling step. To
crown all, there is often stuck upon the head a bonnet like
the hat of a typical Irishman, resembling an inverted
flowerpot, with a brim, if brim it be, no broader than that
of the article from which it is copied. Often, too, one sees
a long gown tail flourishing in the dust, which next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
is shaken vehemently by the owner outside her room,
and is brushed assiduously by the maid on the staircase; so
that out of the deposits from this stupid fashion, the wearers
do not positively kill their neighbours, but thoughtlessly
compel them to bite the dust. The picture of French
women, therefore, is not particularly inviting, though there
is often a spicy jauntiness about the mode and ornamentation
of their costume which is peculiarly taking. Upon a
Sunday or fête day, young French children are habited in
the gayest of attire, sometimes smart and pretty, but at all
times to our eyes Frenchy, and frequently with alarmingly
short, expanded petticoats, and long, lanky, bare legs. In
every case, these children must be dressed out of all
proportion to their position in life. Occasionally a child
dressed entirely in white, denoting its dedication to the
Virgin, will be seen. English young ladies may be at
once distinguished from French, inasmuch as they usually
exhibit a most disquieting tightening of the waist. Real
wasps, however, in nothing but the waist, it is truth to say
they carry the palm in appearance and good looks over the
representatives of every other land.</p>

<p class="p2">One of those customs which Sterne could hardly have
said were better ordered in France, is the French mode of
passing people when walking. Instead of doing so upon
the right hand, they pass upon the left, which certainly
does not appear to British people to be nearly so natural
as their own mode; and till the English stranger becomes
habituated to the foreign custom, it is not inapt to produce
a startling, if not a striking, method of seeing eye to eye.
Similarly, a contrary rule exists as regards horses and
vehicles. It would be well if there were one general
system observed all over the world for walking and
driving. In sailing, I think there is already a universal
rule. In saluting, foreigners always lift the hat, be it to
man or woman of their acquaintance, making a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ceremonious swing of the chapeau, but little inclination
of the body, and no movement whatever of the countenance,
thus imparting the impression of a very superficial, heartless
politeness. Perhaps there may be more kindliness in the
practice, at Mentone and elsewhere, of every man or woman
met in the mornings in the hotel saluting you and
expecting you to salute them with a ‘Bon jour.’ At home
in some rural districts a similar usage is occasionally
encountered.</p>

<p>I have not observed many beggars in France, but in
Mentone, so close upon Italy, there are some professional
or regular mendicants always hunting the promenade and
other parts; while all the native children have been taught
a very evil custom, which many men and women also
practise, of coming up to visitors, holding out the hand and
saying, ‘Donnez moi un sou,’ or simply, ‘Un sou’ (Give me
a halfpenny); and some visitors, unconscious of doing harm,
give them sous. An American gentleman told me he had
given away 8 sous in a single forenoon, being all that he
had about him. The children do not require them, and it
teaches them a very bad lesson, sapping their independence.
Sometimes the method is varied by presenting bunches of
wild-flowers, or by lying in wait and tossing the bouquet
into passing carriages; for which, of course, they expect, if
accepted, to be recompensed.</p>

<p class="p2">An excursion to Monte Carlo and Monaco is one which
even the most inveterate promenade walkers will at times
take; and it is, indeed, a very favourite one with most
Mentone visitors, many going weekly, and even oftener. The
distance to Monte Carlo is about six or eight miles, and
young people occasionally walk it. Driving by carriage is
undoubtedly a most enjoyable mode of going. The road,
after passing some elegant villas, including the palace of
the Carnoles family, the former residence at Mentone of
the princes of Monaco, for great part of the way is bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
by olive and other trees, embosomed in the midst of which,
here and there, are brightly-painted houses and large villas
with a grand background of lofty mountains. Glorious
views are had by the way not merely of the mountain
scenery, but of the bays, of Cape Martin, of Rochebrune, of
white-terraced Monte Carlo, and of the singular projecting
rock of Monaco with its castellated walls and buildings,
and overtopping it, rising with great abruptness, the mountain
called Tête de Chien, resembling very much in shape
Salisbury Crags at home, only three times as high, the
height being stated to be 1810 feet. Just below Rochebrune,
the road, keeping by the coast to Monte Carlo, diverges
from the Corniche road, which slowly ascends and surmounts
the Tête de Chien.</p>

<p>The railway is a more rapid means of conveyance, but
its hours do not always fit in with the visitor’s time.</p>

<p>The famous gambling tables at Monte Carlo, established
in 1856, are, I believe, the only thing of the kind now left
in Central Europe. The French Government, it is thought,
would fain acquire the principality, so as to put down this
pernicious institution; but I presume it would be too
costly, at least in present circumstances, to arrange. To
attract visitors to the place, the grounds have been laid out
in beautiful terraces flanked by elegant white balustrades,
the borders being filled with palm and other exotic trees and
shrubbery. The main attraction, however, is contained in
the Casino, which is a long handsome building, in which
are a spacious concert room, a reading room with newspapers,
and the gambling rooms. A first-class instrumental band,
numbering between seventy and eighty performers, attached
to the establishment, plays gratuitously to the visitors every
afternoon and evening, and on Thursdays gives a selection
from classic music. This daily concert, to which dramatic
and other entertainments are sometimes added, forms an excellent
excuse to many for going to Monte Carlo; and I have
seen persons whom I would not have suspected of passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
fondness for music, visiting it day after day&mdash;the real moving
cause being, no doubt, the hazard table. To see the mode
of operation, I once entered the room where the gambling
is carried on. For this purpose, application must be
made, in a room off the hall, for a ticket of admission,
which specifies the length of time, say a month or two
months, during which the holder desires to use it. Upon
presenting a visiting card, and stating residence and country
to which the applicant belongs, the admission card is at
once filled up and handed over; but it is refused to natives of
Monaco, nor are young people allowed to enter the room.
The roulette tables are divided into squares, and corresponding
numbers from O to 36. The gamesters place their
money stakes upon the squares, or, if they desire to spread
their chances, upon the lines which divide them. A revolving
wheel and a small ball are then simultaneously set in
motion, and both circulate many times before they stop.
According to the divisional number of the wheel into which
the ball eventually falls, the fate of the stakers is determined.
The table has the advantage of 1 in 36 in its
favour, so that in the long run it always gains. If the
gambler stake upon a number into which the ball rolls, he
gets thirty-five times the amount of his stake; if upon the line
between two numbers, and the ball fall upon one of them,
he gets only half; if staked at the junction of four lines,
correspondingly less. If O (zero) turn up, nobody gets anything,
unless zero have been staked on, and the player then
gets thirty-six times his stake. I do not profess either to
describe the rules or even to know them, and state these facts,
possibly inaccurate, merely upon casual information. The
roulette stakes are not less than 5-franc pieces, and are often
gold; but the highest amount which can be staked at one
adventure is 6,000 francs, £240. It is astonishing with what
rapidity the game is renewed and carried on. The sums are
laid down by the eager onlookers, and as soon as the table is
formed, which it takes a very short time to do, round goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the wheel; and when the ball falls into one of the spaces
marked on the wheel, one of the men stationed at the table
calls out the number, rapidly pulls in the losing money,
and shovels out with equal rapidity the sums which are
gained. Not a moment is lost; the table is again formed,
and the ball again decides the fate of those who peril their
money on its uncertain movements. There are three such
tables in the rooms, at each of which there are three or
four men in charge; and each table is always surrounded
by a crowd of onlookers and players, many of whom are
persons who evidently cannot afford to lose money. There
is a fourth table, at which the lottery is decided by a foolish
game at cards, called ‘<i>trente et quarante</i>.’ The stakes here
are always in gold, and the play is for much higher sums
than at roulette, the lowest stakes being 20 francs, and
the highest 12,000 francs (£480). I believe that most
people not withheld by principle, upon visiting the rooms,
try their luck; and some visit the neighbourhood with a
given sum, which they risk from time to time till all be lost,&mdash;a
species of ‘limited liability’ which is better than total
want of restraint. Whether a first loss always is the least,
or often withholds from further play, I do not know; but I
fear that, in general, a spirit of infatuation seizes upon
people, tempting them either by failure to retrieve loss, or by
success to go on further and lose all. Most of the habitual
players watch the turning of the wheel, and form their
own ideas or calculations as to what numbers or combinations
of numbers are fortunate, and act accordingly. It is
a sad temptation to silly young men, who are often led
on from bad to worse, till they lose all they possess. The
consequences are sometimes distressing. At Mentone we
heard that in one week, while we were there, two young
men, visitors, had committed suicide; but such occurrences
do not reach the newspapers.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to leave this gay though sad scene of a
vicious institution to stroll into the tasteful little shops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
permitted outside, in which enticing fine-art wares in choice
variety are displayed, or wander about the gardens and
terraces, sitting in the sunshine under shelter of the trees
from the air, which is often cold at Monte Carlo when
mild at Mentone, and looking at the lovely scenes around.
But there is, out of doors, one object suggestive of any feeling
but that of admiration; it is the pigeon palace, upon
and around which, unconscious of their fate, the poor pigeons
are seen in crowds, bred to become marks for the would-be
sportsmen. The shooting of these gentle birds is one of
the most barbarous descriptions of pastime; it has not
even the recommendation of sport. The shooters might
as well fire at barn-door fowls.</p>

<p class="p2">The drive from Monte Carlo to Monaco is down a decline
of little more than half a mile. The Palace of Monaco is
visible upon Saturdays, and to see it specially, we devoted
a forenoon. After ascending by a long fortified or walled
road within the castle, the flat summit of the rock was
reached; and here we found a large open space, or esplanade,
or <i>place d’armes</i>, facing the palace and between it and the
town. The palace, however, was not open to the public
till one o’clock; so that we first visited the town, which of
course is a small one, limited to the size of the rock, but
possessing a population of about 1500. It is intersected by
narrow streets, outside of which there are shady walks upon
the south and west margins or edges of the rocks, among
which we rambled, and at parts could look down to the water,
more than 200 feet below. As the rock projects so far into
the ocean, it is withdrawn from the shelter of the mountains,
and is exposed to the mistral as well as to the north wind;
so that the town itself, inhabited solely by the native population,
is no doubt often a cold residence during winter.
The principality, whose independence was recognised by the
Treaty of Paris of 1815, used to extend on the mainland
fifteen miles in greatest length by six in greatest breadth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
In 1860, the Mentone portion was ceded to the Emperor of
the French for £12,000. Monaco is now, therefore, greatly
shorn; but the revenues are said to be 350,000 francs, or
£14,000 yearly. The palace, a large one for a prince
whose territory is now so circumscribed, is square, with a
courtyard in the centre, round which the buildings are
placed, and on one side of which a handsome outside marble
staircase leads to a splendid suite of state rooms. We were
shown through these rooms, each of which is hung and
decorated in a uniform tint or hanging, but each room
differing from the others. It was interesting, a sort of
Versailles in miniature. We were also conducted through
the adjoining gardens at the extreme north and more
sheltered end of the rock, which, though small, are filled
with palm and other trees and plants growing luxuriantly,
forming a pleasant retreat to the inhabitants of the palace.</p>

<p>Monaco is a place of great antiquity, its origin having
been traced back as far as 1700 years B.C. Its history
has been most eventful, and is set forth in full detail in
Pemberton’s <i>History of Monaco</i>, where the oppression suffered
by the people at the hands of its princes, and the
spirited resistance made, especially by the Mentonnais,
who ultimately succeeded, without violence, in throwing off
the yoke, will be found narrated.</p>

<p class="p2">The villas about Mentone are, as already mentioned, like
the generality in the Riviera, painted in lively colours,
and surmounted by tidy-looking red-tiled roofs. Slate is
unknown, though sometimes roofs are covered with what
appears to be lead or zinc, imparting a little variety.
The windows of all the houses have outside jalousies,
generally painted green. These Riviera houses resemble
somewhat in colouring the houses in a German box of
toys, or one of those vividly-coloured dolls’ houses sold
in toyshops. They give a remarkable brightness to the
landscape, more especially where the hills are covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
extensively and monotonously with the sombre olive tree.
All houses are painted, and sometimes very fantastically,
in imitation of shaped stones, carvings, projections, and
other architectural features, and even of roofs, and they
are so cleverly executed that a stranger has often to
approach close to them to detect the illusion. So far is
this sometimes carried, that I have seen a good substantial
house painted to represent it in a state of decay&mdash;an odd
freak; at other times, painted as if vegetation were, under
neglect or abandonment, springing out of chinks between
the painted layers of stones. The houses are built&mdash;with a
certain amount of substantiality, though with wonderful
rapidity&mdash;of a species of rubble, which is plastered over
and sometimes neatly ornamented with stucco mouldings.
Internally, they are in general nicely finished with abundance
of decoration, particularly at the painter’s hands;
though one is sometimes annoyed to find that the plaster
work is of such inferior quality as to be full of cracks,
and even to give way and tumble down. The paintings
on the ceilings are certainly wonderful specimens of art.
Accustomed as people so often are at home to paper
ornamentation, they are apt to suppose at first that these
ceilings must simply be stained paper pieces pasted on;
but on examination, it is found that they are, with some
occasional imitations, all hand-painted. And although
there are many coarse specimens of this style of decoration,
they are frequently finished with great delicacy. The
rooms we ourselves had in Mentone were in this respect,
as well as in others, finished with good taste and skill; and
although the ceilings were prettily painted, they were light
and suitable. Sometimes the decoration of houses is carried
the length of painting cleverly outside garden walls with
scenic views, imitation staircases and theatrical trees, fountains,
grottoes, etc. Marble is used in abundance in the
houses, in chimney-pieces, staircases (outside sometimes as
well as inside), and other portions of the buildings. Proximity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to Italy renders cheap the carriage of the rough marble, which
is wrought up according to requirement at local marble
workshops. Windows are all constructed on the French
fashion of opening up the centre&mdash;a method which is suitable
to the climate, although, not being so close-fitting as
our window-sashes, it would not answer in our own sterner
climate. They are fastened by a bolt, the working of
which the inhabitant requires to understand, as, if not
properly fastened, a window may blow open, as it once did
to us in a gale at Marseilles during the night; and in
ignorance of the way of turning the bolt, much trouble will
be occasioned in the dark. Nearly all rooms open into
those adjoining, on both sides, by a door, sometimes two-leaved.
The consequence is, especially when the partition
walls are thin, that all that goes on in your neighbour’s
apartment is overheard. To remedy this inconvenience, in
part, as well as to add to the warmth of the chambers, the
doors are in first-class houses double, for which a certain
degree of thickness of walls is necessary. Terraces and
balconies are common adjuncts, and enable the inhabitants
in many cases to enjoy the air and the views without leaving
their houses, or scarcely their rooms.</p>

<p>The gardens attached to villas are usually planted with
orange, lemon, and red pepper trees, with aloes, and the
ever-green, and health-producing, rapid-growing Eucalyptus,
besides other trees and plants, natives of a warm
climate.</p>

<p>At Cannes we were taken by a French gentleman through
a large villa he had just built for his own occupation.
Upon the first floor (what we would term the street floor),
above the ground floor, or that occupied by the offices and
servants’ accommodation, and opening out of a large hall,
there was a suite of public rooms, consisting of dining-room
and drawing-room, with intermediate ante-drawing-room&mdash;all
looking to the sun, and of a library and another room
upon the north or non-sunny side of the house. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
floor above, there were six bed-rooms, separate sleeping
chambers being devoted to the husband and wife. The
south windows opened out on each floor to a broad terrace,
looking down upon a large garden, beyond which fine views
were had of the sea and Estrelles. Every room was
finished in the best style.</p>

<p>As I have already said, there is only in reality one
street in Mentone occupied with shops. This is in the
heart of the town, and the shops are few in number,
some of them evidently having a struggle to exist; but
coupled with a vegetable and fruit market, they are
abundantly sufficient, if not more than sufficient, for the
wants of the inhabitants and visitors. None of the shops
can be said to be of any size&mdash;except, perhaps, one of the
bazaars, of which there are several, and in which almost
every description of ware except eatables is sold. And at
Christmas-time they are packed with purchasers in quest
of nicknacks for presents&mdash;toys, photographs, woodwork,
and ornaments of divers descriptions, many of which are
marked with the letters ‘Mentone;’ for it is curious that
the old Italian name is thus preserved in preference to the
French Menton, which is not so euphonious. Things are
generally dear in the shops; in fact, nearly every description
of article is dearer than at home, unless, perhaps, it
may be French writing-paper, which is sold at a moderate
price. All articles of household consumption are dear;
sugar, for instance, is 8d. or 10d. per lb., showing the
French people themselves do not benefit by their system
of bounty on sugar enjoyed by their refiners. Many things,
however, have to be brought from a great distance,&mdash;butter,
I believe, comes from Milan, and is good; fish, from
Bordeaux and other distant ports; books, from Paris and
London,&mdash;and a large percentage is added to the price. I
have been told, but cannot say from experience, that shopkeepers
follow the Italian custom of asking more than
they will take or than the goods are worth, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
disagreeable custom of bargaining is necessary. But the
things we have bought have generally been such that there
could be little room for difference of price. However, it is
extremely likely that, in the market, bargaining is absolutely
needful, and possibly also in some shops. A lady said to
me that at Nice they had to bargain about dress.</p>

<p>The booksellers have circulating libraries, in which are
many English books, including a quantity of Tauchnitz
editions; but the collections are principally of works of
fiction and light reading, and for our second winter at
Mentone I thought it advisable to have a box of selected
books from home.</p>

<p class="p2">If asked to say what is the great industrial occupation
of the inhabitants of Mentone, I think I could not be far
wrong in naming that for women as consisting in the
washing of clothes. In fact, all along the Riviera, as well
as in other parts of France, washing of clothes seems to the
women portion of the working population the sole vocation
of life; although it is difficult to comprehend from whom
all the clothes to fill their hands and baskets come, unless
France be the washing field of the world. At Mentone, go
where one might, women were washing clothes, and that in
a manner most disgusting and repulsive to English notions.
Instead of washing them in some rural part with pure hot
water and soap, wringing out the water and bleaching on
the grass, these women will walk to any spot where a drop
of water can be had, no matter how foul, or whence it
comes, or what are its surroundings. Thus at Mentone
they haunt the rivulets, which are full of olive juice sent
down from the olive mills, the water passing over, as it
trickles down, beds thick with the deposited accumulations of
months of olive refuse, mud, and other dirt; and then, ensconcing
themselves in the baskets in which the clothes are
brought, and on their knees, they stoop down, put the clothes
into the filthy water, and with a wooden roller-pin beat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
unfortunate articles till one might suppose they were beat
into a jelly, or at least into a thousand holes.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The clothes
are thereupon hung up or spread on stones to dry, all in
the view of the population, and along the beach and elsewhere.
There was, indeed&mdash;for it is now disused, in consequence
of the remonstrance made as after mentioned&mdash;one
public washing-place, constructed for the purpose of washing
in; but this was nothing but one long continuous stone
trough, for the use of which, I presume, a small charge was
made. Here I have counted fifty-two women washing at
one time, as close as they could be packed, upon both sides
of this trough, which seemed about sixty feet long and three
or four feet wide. All the garments were washed in one
water, which, I presume, could scarcely be said to have
been changed oftener than once a day at best, although a
trickle of new water might ooze through it. The washing
in this trough, however, was purity itself compared with
what took place elsewhere. I have seen women washing
at one pool of dirty water for weeks together, any fresh
water which could possibly percolate through it being
utterly unable to carry off the soap and dirt of the
washings which stuck to the sides and bottom. Nor was
this the worst. At one narrow aqueduct, full of the
blackest dirt, and with the veriest drop of water struggling
through it, little more than an inch deep, and only secured
by damming it up, and only changed when a flood unexpectedly
came, women were to be seen constantly engaged,
it is to be hoped only on their own clothes.</p>

<p>So offensive has this custom been considered by the
English, that a representation was made to the civic
authorities, and some change for the better was promised;
but whether it has been or will be such as will adequately
meet and remove all the evil complained of, or whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
will simply remove them out of sight, I cannot say. It is
most uncomfortable to think, were there no other objection,
that one’s clothes may be washed in the same water as
that in which, it may be, the clothes of those who have
been suffering from disease are being soaked. Towels and
sheets have, when fresh, a most disagreeable soapy smell.
Linen articles of wearing apparel, however, seem to come
home remarkably pure, and it is to be hoped that they are,
after the first bleaching, put through clean water. Buttons,
however, soon get loose after the violent treatment to which
linens are subjected.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Another grand pursuit of the Mentonnais is that of
fishing. Two or more fishing boats are engaged almost
every morning in this occupation. A boat takes out the
net a long distance, when it is dropped in the water. By
two long lines the nets are then laboriously drawn in upon
the shore by from twelve to twenty men or women. A great
deal of this labour might easily be saved by the use of
windlasses. When the net comes near the shore, a crowd
of visitors and other idle persons surround the fishermen to
witness the result. Often I have seen the net pulled up
without a single fish in it; at other times, a small basketful
of little fish which they call sardines. Sometimes a
few larger fish, a dozen or half a dozen mackerel, may be
taken; but at other times I have seen little more brought
up after all this waste of exertion and time than a quantity
of minute fry about an inch or so long, the young of fish
which might otherwise have attained maturity. The result
is miserable, and one could wish not merely that the men
were better employed, but that there might be some stoppage
put to a mode of catching which must prove so injurious
to the fishings. Is it not likely that a deep-sea line, baited
with so many hooks (such as our fishermen use), would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
large fish and leave the young to develop? But the fishermen
have no doubt fished for two thousand years or more
in the same way, and could not possibly take in the thought
of any novelty; and, patient as they are, one would wish
to see this patience change to enterprising and inventive
vigour. It is, however, to be kept in view that the sardines
for which they lay their snares may apparently be caught
only on the surface, as when there is a surf falling on the
shore I have seen the nets dragged into the boats upon the
sea, and many sardines thereby caught. In stormy weather,
a rare occurrence, the fishing is altogether stopped. Judging
from what I have seen, I should say it was unlikely that
the fishermen earn more than the merest pittance (a few
pence a day) by their calling, in pursuing which they dress
in their worst clothes; and it is well they do so. I have
seen an active young man knocked over and sucked in by
the surf, disappear for a moment, and come out dripping.</p>

<p>But wretched as this occupation is, there is a still more
pitiable phase of the fishing life, consisting in grown men&mdash;not
one alone, but many&mdash;angling the whole day with a long
reed rod and a hook baited with chewed bread. After enduring
hours of waiting, during which their hearts may have
been rejoiced by glorious nibbles, they will entrap some unfortunate
little fish&mdash;generally a small sardine, only fit to be
tossed back into its element; while around the noble fisher,
various idle spectators are congregated, watching his float
and deeply interested in his success.</p>

<p class="p2">Another pursuit, curious in its mode, is that of the
shepherd. Hardly a morning passed but we saw an Italian
shepherd standing about, singularly attired in shaggy coat
and rough knee-breeches, and a species of stocking leggings,
with a short, tawny-coloured Italian cloak on his shoulder,
and a long, conical, Italian wide-awake on his head, the
whole suit bearing traits of the wear of a lifetime. Sometimes
he was accompanied by a boy, a representation or copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in miniature of the same; the copper-brown complexion
and bright dark eyes of both revealing them to be children
of the sun. Near to them on the hard stony beach, a flock
of thin small sheep as gaunt-looking as their herds were
hobbling about on the stones and picking up dried leaves
and anything that once was green which they could find in
this, to them, barren land. He moves, and they follow.
No dog scares them, or collects or pursues them. They
hear his voice and, as if affectionately attached, obey.
When they have traversed the beach, he produces a sack
and spreads upon the ground what looks like sawdust, but
is probably bran, which they eagerly devour. It would
seem as if the sheep never had a chance of browsing on
the hillside, for I do not recollect ever seeing a sheep upon
the grass. Whence they come I know not, but their food
by the road is just the fallen leaves.</p>

<p class="p2">A better occupation than the fishing, although it is
dependent on the weather, is that of letting out donkeys.
What we would regard as great fortunes cannot, of course,
be made out of the small remuneration which the donkey
people receive, but it seems enough to enable them to
appear respectable.</p>

<p>Some employment is also had in the making of wooden
inlaid articles for sale in the shops, generally with the word
‘Mentone’ on them. The articles sell well; but it is said
that many of them come from Sorrento, which is the headquarters
of this description of work, and where it is carried
to the highest perfection, or at least to its largest extent.
The prices asked at Mentone are sometimes double what
are asked for similar work at Sorrento; while the same
variety and beauty of work cannot, I think, be procured,
although a Mentone workman laboured to make me believe
his <i>modus operandi</i> was superior.</p>

<p>The great mass of the Mentone men, however, seem to be
occupied in the various trades connected with house-building&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
quarrying stones; and upon the works of the town,
such as metalling and watering the roads forming the promenades,
etc.; and I must say that the men appear to be
industrious and steady in their application to their appointed
tasks, as well as sober, for during all the time we were in
Mentone, I never witnessed but once a case of drunkenness,
and it was that of two men who apparently were not of
the town, but from the rural parts. Not that they do not
drink, for even the women carry to their work a huge litre
bottle, but their drinking must be in great moderation and of
a weak quality of wine. It is, however, very desirable to
have some saving of human fatigue effected. For example,
instead of lifting large stones by means of cranes, three or
four men may be seen tediously and laboriously moving
them by means of levers, keeping time to an unearthly
sound ejaculated by the foreman or leader of the group.
Labour is no doubt cheap. I suppose that wages do not
exceed 2 francs per day, but the employment of so
many men unnecessarily must add to the expense of public
improvements. I suspect, however, that in this also, as in
other things, there is a conservative clinging to old habits
and customs, and fear of innovations, which it is very difficult
to eradicate, and that men follow in their fathers’ ways just
because their fathers had always done so before them.</p>

<p>Necessarily the visitors bring with them employment to
the inhabitants, such as in dressmaking and the various other
requirements of life; and if one be passing along the main
street of Mentone after the sun has reached the meridian, for
no public clock strikes or bell sounds, he will find it crowded
with girls and men leaving work and going to dinner.</p>

<p>The rural population is mainly occupied with the cultivation
of the olive and the gathering of the olive berries,
which are beaten off the trees by long rods, and picked off
the ground by women and girls; and also, but to a much
more limited extent, with the cultivation of the lemon and
orange trees, and the gathering of their fruit, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
borne off by the women in large baskets on their heads.
There appear to be few vines about Mentone, although
there are a good many kitchen gardens to supply the
needful vegetables for the population. Connected with the
olive cultivation, is the employment of building terraces on
the sides of the hills for the planting of trees. These are
very neatly executed with a smooth facing of stone. The
crushing of the olives in the olive mills also affords employment
to a small class of men; while the building of water
reservoirs or tanks in connection with the terraces, in order
to secure supplies of water for the trees, gives further
occupation. These reservoirs, and the conduits which are
found running all over the hill-slopes to supply them, or
to turn the mill wheels, are scattered everywhere: the tanks
look ugly places to tumble into.</p>

<p>The wages of agricultural labourers, I believe, do not
exceed from 1 to 2 francs per day.</p>

<p class="p2">Assisting the operations of labourers of different kinds,
there are horses, mules, and asses. Frequently a cart will
be drawn by a combination of all the three, a small ass
leading the van, followed by the larger mule, the rear being
brought up by a horse yoked within the shafts of the cart.
The carts are, as a rule, laden far beyond the strength of
the animals drawing them, and it would be well that the
police could sometimes interfere. The horses are willing,
though it is sad to see them occasionally brutally beaten,
to urge them to efforts under which every muscle is strained
to the utmost. But the mountaineers depend mainly on
the ass. On this animal they throw the burden of carrying
up and down the steep and rough hill paths, stones, barrels,
bags, wood, and agricultural produce, etc., and patiently and
intelligently do they perform their work.</p>

<p>One sees here and there poultry, but few comparatively
to the number which are requisite to meet the daily consumption
at the hotels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Small wild birds are scarcely ever seen. I have counted
up six sparrows fluttering about or chirping in the trees;
but a sparrow, like every other small bird, is in France a
<i>rara avis</i>. Three broad-shouldered men, dressed in blouses
like labourers, go out daily with guns to shoot them. One
could almost wish a visitation upon France of the Colorado
beetle, or if birds do not feed on it, of some other insect
plague, to open the eyes of the French to the impolicy of
allowing these small birds to be shot. One of the most
pleasing diversions in Mentone is to sit and watch the
flock (perhaps now only two or three hundred in number)
of sea-gulls which frequent its shores. While you are
witnessing the joyful flights of these beautiful birds,
suddenly you hear a shot fired, and the whole flight rises
and skims away, leaving perhaps a distressed comrade, who
has probably had its wing broken by a bullet. It is
making frantic attempts to rise or to get out to sea. With
right good-will could one pitch into the fellow who had
done this wanton, cruel harm. I believe that the consequence
of the shooting is that the poor birds find their
muster roll greatly reduced, and they may in time disappear
or migrate to some safer locality.</p>

<p>There is one animal which everybody could more readily
wish to disappear, and that is the mosquito. I have
previously mentioned that we did not find this plague so
great at Mentone as at Cannes and Hyères. This may
partly have arisen from our having visited these other
places earlier in the winter; but I think a good deal also is
due to Mentone being better drained, or at least to the
drains not being so offensive.</p>

<p>At Cannes we were also more plagued than at Mentone
with flies. These little animals are very impudent. They
walk over your face and hands, nibbling as they go, and
play at hide-and-seek in your hair. They are not to be
deterred by the most stringent prohibitions; and while one
has no mercy on mosquitoes, you hesitate to inflict the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
extreme penalty of the law upon a fly&mdash;nay, rather help
your tormentors out of their scrapes when they tumble into
water, milk, treacle, or the like.</p>

<p class="p2">It is commonly thought that it must be a disagreeable
feature of Mentone that visitors encounter in their walks so
many invalids there. No doubt there are a good many
invalids at Mentone, and some of them have all the appearance
of being so, but they do not predominate by any
means. Many of them keep their rooms, and those who
go out seldom go beyond the promenade, except for a
drive. It is indeed painful sometimes to see some delicate
invalids who are hopelessly beyond recovery, and particularly
young men, thin, gaunt, and white, well wrapped up,
even on sunny days; but they are never so numerous as to
make Mentone a painful residence. The English people,
as a rule, are wiser than the Continental. They come at
an early stage of their complaint, and get rapidly cured;
while it is said, on the other hand, that people of other
nations come when they are incurable. Of course, some of
these invalids succumb, and from time to time a death
occurs; but a funeral is seldom or never seen. When a
death happens, the hotel people keep it as long quiet as
possible. The authorities take charge of the burial, and
the body, which must lie unburied twenty-four hours after
death, is removed in a coffin after dark to the mortuary
adjoining the cemetery, where the relations assemble usually
on the following day, and it is buried. The expense of
burial is said to be moderate, the charges varying according
to circumstances. But there is one repellent fact connected
with this subject which I have heard exists. It is,
that some of the hotels put up a notice in the printed bills
of charges, which are hung in the bedrooms, that a death
occurring in the house will be charged so much. This is
no doubt done to prevent disputes, and there is fairly reason
for a charge, seeing that the bedding on which the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
person lay is burnt or otherwise destroyed, the room is
unoccupied for a short time, and it is against the hotel;
but the making of this prominent notification shocks one’s
feelings, and may sometimes be injurious to the invalid. I
have not personally seen it.</p>

<p>The cemetery of Mentone, surmounting the hill, on the
ridge and slopes of which the old town is built, has a
picturesque look from below. As usual abroad, the Protestant
ground is separated from the Roman Catholic; the
Catholics, by the narrow feeling of religious exclusiveness,
refusing Protestants burial in the same ground with themselves.
But it collects the strangers the more together,
and it is painful to walk round and think of the many
who are buried so far away from their homes and friends.
We have seen at different places one or two funerals, when
the English service was performed, but at Cannes had the
opportunity of witnessing a funeral service conducted by
the French Protestant clergyman. He was a remarkably
fine-looking old gentleman, and in place of a formal service,
or perhaps in addition to it, for we had not arrived at the
commencement, he made a very touching address to the
relations and others present, and offered a simple earnest
prayer. We could not help thinking that it was so very
much more appropriate than the formal service of the
Church of England, however stately and beautiful, which
so often is rattled over without much appearance of feeling,
and is uniformly the same to all.</p>

<p class="p2">We were three months in Mentone during our first
winter there, and, as may be gathered from what I have
previously said, we had ample means of spending the days
pleasantly. Perhaps the evenings, though pleasant, had too
much of the public life about them, living so much in
family with others. We occasionally longed for the quietness
of home life, which could not be said to be had by
simply retreating to our rooms. Sometimes the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was varied, as I have elsewhere mentioned, by little entertainments,
such as conjurors with their tricks. But we
had, even amidst all the pleasant days we spent there, some
peculiarly red letter days, embracing our more extensive
excursions, and days to be noted.</p>

<p class="p2">Of these, the first was Christmas day. Among the
English people this was maintained in the usual manner;
but we had heard that there would be a grand service
according to the Roman Catholic form in the cathedral or
parish church, and we went thither. The Church of St.
Michael, a large one, dating back, it is said, to the thirteenth
century, was draped with crimson cloth, and a profusion of
gold or gilt articles was displayed at the altar, which
was lighted up with an immense quantity of candles. The
place was crammed with people, the crowd even extending
a good way outside the door. After the usual service
and chanting, the great event of the day took place.
Several priests, preceded by a tall janitor in cocked hat
and uniform and halberd, in humble imitation of the grand
man of the Madeleine, commenced parading through the
church, one of them bearing in his arms a wax doll, baby
size, as if new born, which he held out to be kissed; and
every one, even respectable-looking people, pressed forward
as they slowly progressed to kiss the doll’s foot. When
he came our length, the priest, a jolly fat man, who, whatever
he may have felt at the absurdity of the scene,
contrived to keep his countenance, quietly, seeing at a
glance we were Protestants, or what was the same thing,
‘Anglais,’ presented it to others, and did not give us a
chance. A priest behind him took up the collection.
Each person, besides, had to pay for the use of a chair,
some paying for two, one being used to kneel on.</p>

<p class="p2">New Year’s day is, however, the great day among the
native population; and gifts among the foreigners are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
usually then exchanged, in place of, as with the English,
on Christmas day. A very common form of such gifts is
that of a large bouquet of flowers, generally more than a
foot in diameter, laid out in circular symmetrical rows, the
flowers on short stalks being supported by wires. They
look pretty, but stiff, and do not last so long as our assorted
bouquets with their long stalks. On occasion of a birthday,
the heroine of the day, if popular, and the event were
known, would often get three or four such sent to her.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 3d of February we saw bands of young men
parading the streets in an uproarious manner, with flags,
and preceded by drummers beating the usual rat-tat-tat.
We could not imagine what this meant, until informed
that it was the day upon which the young men drew lots
for the selection of those who were to serve as conscripts
in the French army. The noise and merriment were, like
the tom-tom at a Hindoo suttee funeral pile, doubtless
intended to hide the agony and to drive away thought, if
they any had, from the ‘chosen few.’</p>

<p>A week later witnessed the grandest event of the season,
for on 10th February the keeping of the Carnival commenced.
For some days previously, the shops were full
of false faces, wire gauze masks, strange dresses, and
confetti; and cars were in course of decoration for the event,
which necessarily, in a small place like Mentone, could only
be upon a small scale. The coming affair was the grand
talk of the town, and we had even some masquerading
before it came. At last the eventful morning dawned.
It was a complete holiday. Every one turned into the
streets, or took possession of windows, balconies, and other
salient points; while the promenade was ornamented with
long venetian decorated poles, such as we had planted in
the streets of Edinburgh when the Queen came to unveil
the Prince Consort’s statue in 1876. Balconies were
draped, flags were everywhere fluttering in the breeze, and
the Cercle where prizes were to be distributed was gaily
dressed with evergreens and coloured calico. At mid-day
the procession was expected to move; but it was much
too important to move off so early, and did not commence
till two o’clock. Meantime the streets were filled with
people in the oddest and most comical attire, with masks
on their faces, rendering them unrecognisable by their
friends. One of these figures was absurdly dressed in
feathers as a huge cock, while another represented a still
larger eagle. All this time the people were peppering
each other with confetti, small round chalk pellets smaller
than peas. But the grand peppering was reserved for the
procession, which at last hove in sight. It was preceded
by a car filled with musicians in carnival costume, who did
not play, being probably afraid lest their instruments
might suffer damage. Then a long row of fancy soldiers
ambled forward on horseback, two and two, dressed in a
uniform of blue coat and white trousers, looking very gay.
Then various cars were dragged slowly or staggeringly along
in odd devices, one of which was the representation of a
gigantic lobster pie filled with men dressed out in red as
boiled lobsters, while the horses had vast coverings as
black or unboiled lobsters. Another car personified
classical statuary, the men and women being chalked or
painted over in white, and intended to be motionless, but
as taken being well shaken, not always succeeding in
preserving either rigidity or composure. Various other
cars, besides walking figures, and people in carriages, all
disguised, completed the procession, which, like a stage
army, to make up for the want of numbers, passed round
the circle and repassed repeatedly. All this time, the
people in the street, or on the balconies or scaffoldings
erected for the occasion, and in the carriages and cars,
continued to fire away at each other a copious shower of
confetti. These were discharged with a right good-will;
but all, except the improvident, being protected by masks
and calico garments, no damage was suffered, except when
a man audaciously appeared in a good hat, which hat was
battered by discharges of confetti without mercy. Young
men and young ladies adopted the novel method of flirting
by vigorously pelting each other, and wicked men would
quietly and furtively slip a handful of confetti down a
woman’s open neck. This tomfoolery was begun upon the
Saturday and continued upon the Monday, but was not
practised upon the Sunday at Mentone. At Nice, however,
where the English do not preponderate, the Carnival, which
was there upon a larger scale, was kept up on the Sunday,
and about twenty of the visitors (foreigners, of course) at
our hotel went to Nice to see it. On the Monday night
the promenade was lighted up by means of paper Chinese
lanterns, and there was an exhibition of fireworks, concluding
with setting in blaze a giant figure representing
‘the Mentone man,’ well stuffed with tar. The streets on
the following day, as well as previously, were covered
with the chalk pellets, and it was some time before they
were swept and restored to their ordinary condition.</p>

<p class="p2">Of a different sort were other days regarded as eventful
in so quiet a place as Mentone. A fall of snow was
an event, the discovery of ice in the river, even a rainy
day was to be noted. But of all days of this description,
those in which Corsica was visible were the greatest, and
the query when friends met on such days always was,
‘Have you seen Corsica this morning?’ It was only in
peculiar states of the atmosphere that this distant island
became visible, and it happened perhaps six times in the
winter. Just before sunrise,&mdash;generally from a quarter to
half an hour before, if the atmosphere was particularly
clear, and especially if frosty,&mdash;the sun rising behind
Corsica revealed the tops of mountains from 90 to 130
miles off, and from 6000 to 9000 feet high: the vision
remained till the sun rose to the horizon, when it disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
I was always on the watch on likely mornings,
and succeeded in taking a sketch of the view, which, by
verifying at each successive appearance, I rendered exact.
The engraving opposite is a little more than half that of
the original sketch, which was just as seen. Only on one
occasion was Corsica visible during the day. This happened
in the second winter, on 26th November 1877. I had seen
it in the morning, and was incredulous when informed in
the forenoon that it was then visible. Seeing was believing,
however; for there it was, and it remained in sight the whole
day till four o’clock, the sun throughout shining brightly <i>on</i>
it instead of behind it, so that this appearance was quite
different from what was seen in the morning. I looked
upon it as the harbinger of wet weather, and accordingly
for some days afterwards we had rain.</p>

<p class="p2">By the end of February we began to prepare for leaving
Mentone to travel in Italy. During December we had
five days, during January two days, and during February
three days with more or less rain&mdash;eleven days altogether
out of ninety. Besides these days, which were also cold,
we had as many more days which were cold or stormy
without being wet. All the other days, even with the
north or east winds blowing, were fine and sunny. There
were very few days in which an invalid could not venture
out. In fact, more than three-fourths of the weather was
fine and sunny, and often as hot as a hot day in July at
home. On 27th February, however, we had an eclipse of
the moon, which was total. It must, I think, have had a
serious effect upon the temperature, for immediately afterwards
it became extremely cold; so much so that there was
ice for the first time on the river, and it was needful at
last to don our winter attire. We had planned to leave
upon the 2d March, but the day was such as to necessitate
postponing our departure till the morrow. We proceeded
by carriage to San Remo.</p>

<h2 class="p2">X.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>SAN REMO AND GENOA.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> were now proceeding into a country with which
many old associations were united, running back to schoolboy
days,&mdash;a land over whose sunny skies and vine-clad
fields so many raptures have been uttered; a land bearing
evidence in its deeply-interesting ruins of the power of a
great empire long since passed away; a land of the old classic
literature, and of so much that was grand in ancient art.
The pleasure of visiting it, long looked for, had come at
last, and with high anticipation (a feeling, I suppose,
common to most people) we entered Italy.</p>

<p>Our great difficulty on leaving Mentone was the
weather. Friends who had just been travelling spoke of
having had in Italy great severity of cold and much rain.
One of these friends advised against going so soon, but
another thought we might now without any hesitation set
off. Perhaps impatient to leave after having formed our
plans, we resolved to adventure, upon the theory of the
Scotch saying, generally applied to the converse of the case,
that the cold would be, as the spring advanced, ‘a fault
aye mending.’ As it turned out, we would have been
better to have waited eight or ten days longer after the 3d
of March, the date of our departure; and, judging from our
experience on this occasion, I should say that about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
middle of March is the earliest time to commence a tour in
Italy, after spending a winter in the sheltered regions of
the Riviera. It is not only cold previously, but, except in
favoured spots, the prospect is bleak and wintry. The
vines which in the summer grow so luxuriantly and are so
extensively cultivated, are leafless, the trees are bare, and
the fields black.</p>

<p class="p2">We left old friends, and as we rattled through the street
of Mentone we passed familiar places sorrowfully. Shortly
afterwards we reached the Pont St. Louis, and were in Italy.</p>

<p>At the <i>douane</i> station beyond the bridge, we were
stopped by the <i>douaniers</i>, who made a show of examining
luggage; but they saw we were <i>bona fide</i> travellers, and we
were not detained more than a few minutes. This brevity
of detention and being spared the annoyance of having
all one’s luggage turned out and tossed about, are two great
advantages of proceeding by carriage. Passengers going by
railway to Italy from Mentone are stopped at Ventimiglia
for a weary hour, and must submit to the usual inspection.</p>

<p>The <i>douane</i> roadside station, to which we had often
walked, stands high, and commands a remarkably good
view of Mentone and all its surroundings. We looked
back from this point and others on our way, not knowing
if we should ever see this cherished spot again.</p>

<p class="p2">At the time we left Mentone, and for the greater part of
the way, the air was full of an odour not over agreeable,
and I fancied that it might be that the olive trees were
being manured,&mdash;a process to which they are subjected
every second or third year, when a ditch is dug round each
of them, and part of the manure placed in it consists of
old rags, which the better answer their purpose the older
and filthier they are.</p>

<p>The day was fairly bright in the morning, and while we
had the sun everything looked beautiful; but a black cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
which had been looming in the south arose, and, spreading,
for part of the way obscured the great luminary, so that
we could not see everything in perfection, and might only
imagine how much more charming some parts must have
been, had they been brightened by its rays. The want of
sun also, as usual, chilled the air.</p>

<p class="p2">We passed Belinda and Mr. Hanbury’s garden, and came
in sight of Ventimiglia, which lies about seven miles from
Mentone. It is fortified, and commands the Corniche
road and access to Italy in that direction. The town
itself has rather a striking appearance, and is well worth a
visit. It was an old Roman station, and in the time of
Augustus a flourishing place, adorned and supplied with
temples, baths, and other accessories of Roman life. Many
remains of these ancient times have been found, and at
present the ruins of an amphitheatre about a mile eastward
have been discovered and are being exposed. Enterprise
in the direction of excavation is sure to reward the
authorities, who are undertaking it. A broad torrent bed
intersects the town, through which the Roja, a stream
larger than any at Mentone, flows. The banks of this
stream, which really contains water, were lined by washerwomen
pursuing their occupation according to the manner
of those at Mentone, already described. This river is
crossed by a bridge, whence a fine view is had up the wide
valley to the mountains.</p>

<p class="p2">The road onward from Ventimiglia is dotted on each
side by Italian houses, and offers a pleasant drive. After
proceeding four miles, we arrived at Bordighera, or, as it is
sometimes spelled, Bordighiera.</p>

<p>The promontory on which this small town lies, stretches
far out into the sea. The town itself has been built on its
west slope, and from Mentone always looks clothed in
sunshine. Probably its half insular position may give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
certain amount of softness to the air. It is now becoming
a place of resort for invalids. The stranger population
apparently is about from 150 to 200, more than one-half
of whom are English. It is thought more bracing than
Mentone, and may suit some constitutions; but it seems to
want the shelter which most invalids require, and which is
obtained elsewhere. It is, however, a bright-looking place,
with several hotels. The Hotel de Bordighera, newly
opened, is very pleasantly situated, with large garden in
front. The other hotels are ‘D’Angleterre,’ ‘Beau Rivage,’
‘Bellevue,’ and ‘Pension Anglaise.’ There are also about
twenty villas, besides other houses, in which quarters may
be obtained.</p>

<p>The people of Bordighera obtained from the Pope the
privilege of supplying Rome with palms at Easter, in the
manner afterwards mentioned (p. 298). The palm tree here,
therefore, is a subject of special cultivation. We found the
palm garden closed, presumably in preparation for Easter.
Leaving the carriage, we ascended to the church or cathedral
in the old town,&mdash;always a prominent object from Mentone,&mdash;and
from this point, whence an extensive view is
obtained, we took our last look, for that time, of the place
where we had spent the previous three months so happily.
Returning reluctantly to the carriage, we drove on, and soon
passed round to the other side of the promontory, which
thereupon shut out of view all the places whence we had come,
and after proceeding seven or eight miles, reached San Remo.</p>

<h3>SAN REMO.</h3>

<p>San Remo is a place much recommended by physicians,
often in preference to Mentone. Its air is said to possess
all the invigorating qualities of that of Nice, with the
warmth of that of Mentone; to be warm, exhilarating and
soothing, and conducive to sleep. The mean winter
temperature is stated by some accounts to be from 54° to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
59° Fahrenheit; spring, 63° to 68°; summer, 72° to 85°;
and autumn, 66° to 72°.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The icy Tramontane wind is said
to be only slightly felt, and that in the west and more
exposed end of the town, while the mistral is only known
as a high wind. It is also asserted that the natives are
healthy and long-lived. With all these recommendations
as a health resort, San Remo cannot be considered to
possess the attractions of Mentone, and it was with a
feeling of disappointment we first entered the place.
Perhaps our disappointment was increased by the difficulty
of obtaining accommodation, and by the contrast in what
we did obtain with what we had enjoyed at Mentone.</p>

<p>Arriving at the West End, we found all the hotels there
full, and were glad to secure accommodation in one within
the town, possessing a garden, dreary and overlooked by
houses. The place&mdash;at all events externally&mdash;was not
inviting; and as the weather was, during the greater part
of our sojourn on this occasion, bad, with rain, our first
impressions were not favourable.</p>

<p class="p2">San Remo is, like Mentone, surrounded by a half circle
of mountains, but of a much softer-looking character.
Bignole, the highest, is 4300 feet high. They do not
approach so closely to the town, nor do they rear their
heads so boldly, grandly, and picturesquely, but they do so
without gap. In rear of them, though not visible from the
town, are other and higher mountain ranges, belonging to
the Maritime Alps. What are called rivers exist,&mdash;small
narrow streamlets, scarcely amounting to what in Scotland
we should term ‘burns,’&mdash;which trickle through the town
(the Romulo after heavy rain was only three or four feet
wide and a few inches deep); but they do not pass through
valleys like those which give so marked a character to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Mentone. San Remo also wants the protecting arms which
Cape Martin, and Belinda, and Bordighera send out west and
east into the sea. Capo Nero on the west and Capo Verde
on the east no doubt create a bay, but are comparatively
stunted arms. Then the railway passes along the coast
and cuts the inhabitants off from the sea. There is therefore
no promenade or road along the coast&mdash;a stupid mistake,
to which the authorities ought never to have consented,
and which deprives San Remo of what otherwise would
have been its main attraction as a place of residence. The
new town contains only a few good shops, in which things
are not cheap. The old town, with a population double that
of Mentone, is much larger than that of its rival. It is
situated on a similar, but larger and loftier hill; but, unlike
Mentone, which rests on the east, it rests mainly on the
west slope of the hill, and is no doubt very picturesque,
probably one of the most picturesque towns of the kind
built for protection from the Algerine pirates. But though
this may give value to it in the artistic eye, it is not a
quality which contributes either to health or comfort; and
one may justly say, parodying a common saying, ‘picturesque
and nasty.’ Dirt, indeed, everywhere reigns&mdash;nay, some
of the drains, even in the newer portion of the town, would
seem to be above ground; and we found on our first visit
the smells villanous,&mdash;a remark I am bound, however, to
observe was not so applicable on occasion of our visit in
the following year.</p>

<p>The railway station occupies a prominent position in the
town, and passes by or cuts off the harbour, which lies outside
of it. From the battlements or breakwater of this
most untidily-kept harbour, a good view is had of the town
and the mountains behind it. I made the ascent of the
town through long narrow dirty winding vias, like Edinburgh
High Street closes, only they are narrower, steeper,
and tortuous, and far more dirty and unsavoury. Sometimes
the road, paved with stone throughout, lies under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
dismal arched vaults, while the houses on each side are
irregular and dilapidated&mdash;foul, dark, and dreary dens, rather
than habitations for human beings. It was some relief to
reach the platform on the summit, on which the large
church called the sanctuary stands. From this point an excellent
view is had all around. I descended by another of
those curious vias, in which the houses support each other
by arched flying buttresses, intended as a security against
the effects of earthquakes, of which, however, we obtained no
specimen shock during either of our visits to San Remo.</p>

<p class="p2">The mountains and hill-slopes surrounding San Remo are
densely covered with olive trees, and to some extent with
lemons, and afford shelter and walks to the visitors, but of
a character differing entirely from those at Mentone. On
the hillsides many wild flowers grow in rich profusion&mdash;hyacinths,
narcissi, anemones, tulips, mignonette, gladioli,
and others. Those who have been out exploring the country
in the spring, return generally laden with bouquets, or
rather bundles, of bright-coloured flowers.</p>

<p class="p2">Various excursions which may be taken to places among
the mountains by assistance of donkeys, are described in a
little volume called <i>San Remo as a Winter Residence</i>, by an
Invalid, 1869 (Wm. Hunt and Co., London), to which, for
further information regarding the town and locality, I would
refer. I believe a lady is bringing out another guide-book
with information up to date. In 1869, it would appear
from the ‘Invalid’s’ little book that there were then only
five hotels and twenty-three villas. Since the extension of
the railway to San Remo, the number of both has largely
increased. Now there are nine hotels and pensions in the
east division of San Remo, and eleven in the west, some of
which are said to be expensive. Of the West End hotels,
one or two are situated well up on a hill-slope, the fatigue
of greater ascent and the additional exposure being no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
doubt considered to be balanced by the expanded prospect.
There are now also fully eighty villas east and west.</p>

<p class="p2">San Remo possesses, besides, a small public garden to the
west of the old town&mdash;a very nice piece or strip of ground
at the West End, laid out in walks and shrubbery, gifted by
the Empress of Russia, who had honoured San Remo by her
residence there some years ago. The gift is an accession
to the place, and a pavilion has been erected, in which the
band plays on certain days of the week. On other days it
plays in the public garden or in a rondo at the East End. The
West End of the town, where several of the best hotels are,
has an open view to the sea,&mdash;that is to say, the sea can be seen
from the road and public grounds,&mdash;and it is consequently
more cheerful than the east; but it is much more exposed
to the winds. The east end is more sheltered, and is thought
to be more healthy. From the centre of the town eastwards,
a broad pavement runs, provided here and there with
wooden seats for the wearied pedestrian, and is practically
terminated by the Hotel Victoria&mdash;a comfortable house,
having a large garden reaching down to the sea, though the
railway intersects a small portion of it at the bottom. A
large hotel, called the Mediterranée, has recently been
built adjoining the Victoria, having a similar piece of ground
stretching to the railway and sea also, though of course
more newly laid out as a garden. All along this road, till
it reaches a point nearly two miles from the old town, it is
cut off even from the view of the sea, to which the only
access is by many narrow filthy walled lanes. Beyond the
Victoria there are various nice villas, one especially, called
the Villa Patrone, a choice specimen of elegant design, and
of a mode of wall ornamentation in pebble peculiar to the
Riviera.</p>

<p class="p1">From these lists it appears that San Remo is principally
frequented by the Germans and the English. A reason for
the Germans flocking to San Remo, is no doubt to be found
in the fact that Cannes, Nice, and Mentone are within
French territory, where Germans are not particularly
welcome&mdash;in truth, are sometimes, as I know in one
instance, received by the French with marked rudeness;
though it is to be hoped that this state of feeling, not
unnatural after the late calamitous war, is now subsiding.
But it may be taken as corroborative of this observation,
that, judging from the lists published in the beginning of
December 1877 (the very commencement of the season),
out of about 850 names of strangers in Mentone (I state it
roughly and without computing the number of families
these names represent), only between 70 and 80 were
German, principally ladies; while, so far as I can ascertain,
there was only one German doctor in Mentone against
six German doctors in San Remo&mdash;a fact, if I be correct,
which speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Excluding the German element, therefore, it will be seen
that the English very nearly equal all those of other
nations put together. At the same time, one must observe
that such lists require to be taken in a very general way.
Implicit reliance upon them cannot be placed, as I have
so often seen that names which ought to have appeared
have been omitted for a whole season. Everything depends
upon how the list is made up. If made up from persons
handing in their own names to the newspapers, then it
fails, because there are many who never think of doing so,
while even hotelkeepers (whose interest one would think
is to reveal the popularity of their houses) are very careless
in furnishing complete information.</p>

<p class="p2">The San Remo <i>Liste Générale des Étrangers</i>, besides other
intelligence, gives the names of the ‘Medicins,’&mdash;viz., six
German, three English, one French, one Russian, and thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Italian doctors. There are both German and English
Protestant churches. The English church is a commodious
building: the incumbent is the Rev. Mr. Fenton. The
United Presbyterians of Scotland&mdash;I think the only station
possessed by that body abroad&mdash;had worship in two rooms
of the Villa Marguerita, where once a day on Sundays, the
Rev. James Robertson of Edinburgh (just deceased) was,
during our first visit, addressing, in a homely manner,
crowded audiences; while in the evening he had service in
a room of the Hotel des Londres, in which he was then
residing, the English visitors of the hotel turning in to listen
to one much respected by them all,&mdash;all sympathizing, too,
in the sad cause which brought him to a place where he was
destined, like so many others, to leave a loved one behind.</p>

<p class="p2">The great industry of San Remo necessarily consists in
the cultivation of the olive tree; but one minor occupation
is derived from the olive groves in the fabrication of articles
of olive wood. That of San Remo is of a lighter colour
and richer grain, and takes a higher polish than the olive
wood of Sorrento. In the matter of inlaying, however, it
does not appear to me that San Remo comes up to the
better quality of Sorrento work, while the articles made are
sold at a much higher price. The shopkeepers, I was told,
consider the foreigners, and I suppose especially the
English, as legitimate prey, and charge them more than the
natives; nor do they ask high prices, as they do in other
Italian places, with the intention of after abatement, but
they stick to the price demanded, and are very stiff to
move.</p>

<p>On one of the hill-slopes about a mile and a half out of
town, we found a chocolate manufactory, the material for
which comes all the way from Bordeaux.</p>

<p class="p2">The women when young are good-looking; many have
the dark Italian eye, but, like the Mentone women, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
acquire, from the drudgery to which they are exposed, a hard-looking
and dried-up appearance. They are treated as
very beasts of burden, and are accustomed from early years
to carry enormous loads upon their heads, far more so than
at Mentone, and they glory in the amount they can carry.
I have beheld one carrying an enormous log of wood on her
head; and barrels, and every description of heavy articles,
are constantly to be seen so carried. A lady told me she
had a heavy oak table carried home to her house by her
gardener’s wife, and it was thought nothing of. Such a
thing as a rope and pulley, much less a crane to lift stones
from the ground to the floors where masons are building a
house, are utterly unknown. The women are employed as
day-labourers, at something like a shilling a day, to carry
the stones aloft on their heads. I have seen a woman, time
after time, carrying a stone or a couple of uneven stones
balanced, the one on the top of the other, on her head,
up ladders nearly perpendicular, to a height of two storeys,
to the stage where the masons were working. All they do
is just to twist a handkerchief in a coil on the head, and
then, with a most extraordinary power of balancing, they
convey the load to where it is wanted. Men very seldom
undertake the drudgery. If they do, they carry a lighter
load, not, however, on their heads, but on the bent back
or shoulders, protected by a sack. I have observed a
woman carrying a stone on her head which it took four of
them to lift. Their skulls and spines no doubt thicken
and acquire some strange amount of hardy strength, but
any nobler faculty must be crushed out of them; yet they
never seem to feel their degradation, and would resent, I
presume, the introduction of appliances by which their
labour would be saved, and at the same time a means of
livelihood taken from them.</p>

<p>Of all the instances, however, of this nature which I
witnessed, the most marvellous was that of carrying a
pianoforte on the head. On our second visit to San Remo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a lady informed me she had seen this sight. It seemed
truly incredible, and perhaps, as she was an American, I
was at first inclined to set it down to the national tendency
to imaginative exaggeration. I looked anxiously for visual
corroboration, seeing being in such a case believing, and
I was not disappointed. The very day of leaving I had
the good fortune to witness the scene, and was thus
enabled to give full credit to the story. Happening
to be in town, I met three women walking steadily
along the street, their bodies erect, one in front and two
behind, with the huge load of a heavy cabinet piano on
their heads. I think each had one hand, at least, raised
to steady it&mdash;a very painful exertion of itself to most people.
Apparently, keeping pace together, this burden was sturdily
carried as if it cost them no effort; while by their side
marched a man in charge, who, I was thankful to observe
(although, as I have read somewhere, it may be observed
elsewhere, I think at Pompeii), carried no instrument of
flagellation in his hand. Probably he would condescend
to assist in raising the piano at starting, and in lowering it
at its destination.</p>

<p>On this subject the writer of the little guide-book I
have already referred to (<i>San Remo as a Winter Residence</i>),
makes these observations (p. 26):&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘The inhabitants of both sexes, but more particularly the women, are very
good-looking, especially those from the country. You see most lovely faces
amongst the girls from fifteen to twenty-five; they have as a rule good
figures also, and neat feet and legs. They walk remarkably well, with a
firm easy step, holding themselves erect. This results from their always
carrying burdens on their heads, with which they go along at a quick steady
pace, uphill or down, on rough roads or smooth, without ever raising a hand
to support them, unless very large or clumsy in form. You seldom see a
woman without something on her head; if she has not her bundle or her
panniken, she will place the pad there on which she carries them. But this
constant bearing of weights on the head has another and less admirable
result, which is that the women very soon lose their beauty and their
youth. I am told that it is quite usual for a woman to carry 100 kilogrammes
on her head (220 lbs.) up to the mountains, and this every day; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
will also bring a heavy bundle of grass or something back again. The men
walk beside them empty-handed, or oftener still ride the mules and donkeys.
Almost all the carrying is done on women’s heads. If a man has to transport
a heavy weight, he takes his wife with him to carry it. I ordered a
wooden horse for my saddle; the joiner who made it brought it home
certainly, but on his pretty little wife’s head, not his own. The men
consider it a disgrace to carry anything, a parcel even, and a woman’s
highest ambition is to keep her husband in perfect idleness. A friend of
mine, an English lady, was riding on a donkey one very hot day, accompanied
by my servant Giovanni, a San Remese, who was, of course, trudging
on foot by her side, and reflecting the heat of the day on her face. As they
went along, they met a party of country people coming down from the
mountains. In passing, a man, one of the party, stopped and spoke
earnestly to my servant, who gave a laughing reply. When they had
passed, my friend asked what the man had said. “Oh,” replied Giovanni,
“he was telling me I ought to make you get off the donkey, and ride myself
instead.” We had lectured him so often on the disgrace of the men taking
their ease while the women worked so hard, that he quite entered into the
facetiousness of the man’s proposition, an Englishwoman being in the case.’</p>

<p class="p1">In the redress of these women’s wrongs, might not an
excellent field for the operations of the Women’s Rights
Association be found?</p>

<p class="p2">Photographs are not cheap in San Remo; but one photographer
(P. Guidi), under the direction of Signor Panizzi,
has produced a large collection, numbering, I think, upwards
of 150 specimens, size of nature, of the botany of San
Remo. These are beautifully coloured from the plants
themselves, and form a valuable and interesting illustration
of the flora of the district.</p>

<p class="p2">We remained in San Remo from Saturday till the
following Wednesday. The weather having been wet and
disagreeable, we were by no means sorry when, the
Wednesday morning proving fine, we resolved to quit a
place where we had felt far from comfortable, and to
proceed to Genoa by railway. I had, on arrival, exchanged
at the banker’s a circular note, for which i got at the rate
of 27·20 francs or lire per £ in Italian paper money. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
my first experience of this kind of money, and although
it brought a premium of 22 francs per £10, the bundle of
little notes was at first by no means assuring. However, I
soon began to find it extremely convenient as well as
profitable to exchange into paper. I paid the hotel bill and
the railway fares both in paper, even although in the former
case there was a notice up in the hotel requiring (although
paper is a legal tender) visitors to pay in gold; and everywhere
afterwards in Italy, paper was received as full value
for what it represented. We had here for the first time to
pay for all registered luggage according to weight. Putting
railway fare and luggage cost together, however, the expense
was, especially reckoning a deduction of 9 per cent.
by use of paper, moderate. The fare first-class from San
Remo to Genoa was 15 francs each, adding proportion of
charge for luggage, nearly 3 francs<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> additional for each, say
18 francs or 15s., and deducting exchange, 13s. 4d. for a
journey of about eighty-five miles, which is probably about
a shade more than the average at home for second-class
fare for a similar distance. However, the cost necessarily
varies according to the quantity of luggage registered. To
most Italians, who register none, it would be so much less;
to many ladies who cannot travel without innumerable
dresses, so much more.</p>

<p>Upon escaping from San Remo, the railway leaves the
coast line and keeps a little inland&mdash;at least it nowhere cuts
off any of the coast towns from the sea; nor could it well do
so, as nearly all are built close upon the beach. It therefore
proceeds rather behind them or through their outskirts;
and, partly owing to this and partly to the numerous&mdash;vexatiously
numerous&mdash;tunnels through which the railway
is, from the hilly nature of the country, constrained to run,
the views had, of the towns at least, cannot be equal to
what is obtained by driving along the Corniche road.
These Italian towns are exceedingly picturesque, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
appearance and in situation, and there can be no doubt
that one misses much by travelling by rail, although it
must be added that the route between San Remo and
Genoa by no means equals that between Nice and San
Remo. Clear, pleasing photographs of the towns on the
line are published, and may give one some idea of them;
but they are not, with one or two exceptions, the views
seen from the railway. All views from railway carriage
windows, however, even where no ogre sits to pull
down the blinds, labour under disadvantage, and are too
transient, and often too detached and interrupted, to enable
passengers to catch and retain in memory general views of
any place which a railway passes. On this occasion we had
the carriage to ourselves, and eagerly availed ourselves of
the opportunity to draw up blinds and gaze out right and
left.</p>

<p class="p2">About three miles from San Remo, looking up a valley,
one of those curious old towns which are perched on the top
of a hill becomes visible. I had thought it to be Ceriana,
which lies in that direction, a visit to which is one of the
excursions from San Remo; but it proved, according to
Bædeker, to be a similar town called Bussana. The
picturesque town of Porto Maurizio is invisible from the
railway, which passes under it; while a little farther on,
Oneglia and its harbour are just seen in approaching, and
the railway stops at the landward end of it. However,
at next station, Diana Marina, the railway traveller is
rewarded by a most charming landscape. A chain of
mountains hems in a valley, in the centre of which a
conical hill rises abruptly, and on its top Diano Castello
stands, another of those curious and picturesque
towns which are so common in the Riviera and in
Italy. The scene is one in which an artist’s pencil
might luxuriate. The <i>tout ensemble</i> would make, as it no
doubt has often made, a striking picture. At Alassio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
nine miles farther on, we rested on our journey in the
following year, and I shall return to it, therefore, further on.
But leaving Alassio and passing under its west boundary
the promontory of Santa Croce, looking seawards there was
seen, perhaps about two miles out, the small rocky desolate-looking
island of Gallenaria, on which a former proprietor
had built a house for residence, but where, we were told, and
could readily believe, his more sociable wife refused to live.
Farther on upon the left, inland, but near the railway, the
town of Albenga appears prominently. This is an old
Roman town, and is an episcopal residence. Its many and
thickly-planted towers give to it quite the aspect of a
cathedral city. Touching shortly afterwards at Finalmarina
and Noli, in about three and a half hours from the time of
leaving San Remo, the large and imposing town of Savona,
beautifully situated, came into view a massive-looking
fort towering over and protecting the harbour below.
Here many who travel by carriage leave the road and
proceed to Genoa by rail, and those for Genoa going westward
take carriage from Savona, the reason being, that the
road and rail between Savona and Genoa run parallel to
each other, while the route lacks the attractions of the
remainder of the Corniche drive. From Savona, also, there
is a direct line of railway to Turin. The train moves on,
and eleven miles beyond Savona, reaches Cogoletto, which
is said to have been the birthplace of Columbus, and is
therefore a town of interest. The town, like so many
others, lies on the beach, and the railway station only
affords a view of backs of houses. Shortly after, the train
stops at Pegli, a place about six miles from Genoa, a place
of winter residence, and famous for its gardens, which
attract excursions by visitors at Genoa, besides inducing
others to take up their abode for more or less time at the
hotels of the place. A little after six o’clock we arrived at
Genoa, the train slackening speed as it passed amidst ranges
of lofty buildings, which looked all the more grand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
our eyes for so long had been unaccustomed to the dimensions
of a town so large.</p>

<h3>GENOA.</h3>

<p>For many miles before arrival, we could, from the railway
carriage windows, descry the ‘superb’ city with its
tall lighthouse standing like a sentinel in advance. But
one loses much in arriving by railway instead of by sea.
The view had upon entering Genoa for the first time by
sea is always spoken of as magnificent, and it must
necessarily be very striking. The large natural basin
which forms the port, protected by two long moles or
breakwaters, emanating from each side like two arms,
forms a semicircle nearly two miles in diameter, the east
end terminated by the lighthouse, said to be 520 feet high
above the level of the sea, and the west end crowned by
the large and lofty Church of St. Maria de Carignano.
From the harbour, filled with shipping, the ground rises all
round to a height of 500 or 600 feet in steep slopes, upon
which the city is built; a line of warehouses or other great
white buildings, connected no doubt for the most part, if
not altogether, with the trade of the port, forms the front
rank, and gives an imposing facing to the whole. The
buildings on the west side, however, exhibit but a slender
cordon: the compact mass of the city lies upon the hill-slopes
and hills of the east side, which extend outward
considerably to the south of the east mole. The view,
therefore, on arriving by sea, must be that of looking upon
one-half of the sloping tiers of a gigantic amphitheatre;
while backward from the city, which is surrounded by a
double wall or line of fortification, the Apennines rise in
still higher slopes, bold and stern, and probably afford some
protection from the north winds.</p>

<p>Thus looks the famous city, once thriving by commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and powerful, till a spirited foreign policy led, as its natural
consequences, to expensive wars, to weakness and decay.
It revived, however, in time, and manifests a scene of peaceful
busy industry, conferring upon it the position of being
the first commercial town of Italy.</p>

<p class="p2">The façade of the railway station is one of great elegance.
It is built of white marble, with beautiful columns surmounted
by rich sculptured entablature. In the large open
space or piazza in front, in the midst of shrubbery, there
has been placed a beautiful monumental statue of
Christopher Columbus, on a high round pedestal which
rests on a large square base. The circular part, forming the
upper portion of the pedestal, adorned by prow heads of
an ancient or conventional type, is surrounded by four
allegorical seated figures, one at each corner, representing
religion, geography, strength, and wisdom, and by bas-reliefs
delineating events in the hero’s life. Columbus
stands pointing with his finger to a recumbent nude
American-Indian lying at his feet. The whole is of white
marble, and bears on the base a simple dedication.</p>

<p>It is a noble monument, and affords, as it were, at the
very threshold of Italy, a remarkable specimen of Italian
skill in sculpture, and particularly in graceful grouping of
figures, and in designing a pleasing and handsome pedestal,
from which those who have had charge of some recently-erected
monuments at home might have done well to have
taken a hint.</p>

<p>However, we had no opportunity then of studying either
station or monument. We hastened to the omnibus of the
Hotel de Gênes, and drove there with a large company of
English, by whom this hotel would seem to be principally
patronized. Some of the hotels in Genoa are planted in
undesirable localities. This one is situated facing the open
piazza, where in the morning market is held, and in the
immediate neighbourhood of all the principal buildings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
good streets, the principal theatre, Carlo Felice, being
opposite, and the post office within a stone-throw. Like
most of the buildings in Genoa, the hotel is of a somewhat
palatial order, having wide lofty staircases and rooms, some
of them oppressively large. A bedroom we had seemed to
be about 30 feet long by about 20 feet high.</p>

<p class="p2">The day continued fine throughout, but heavy rain fell
through the night, and the next morning was very cold.
We drove about for two hours to see the town; but it
became so cold, wet, and windy, that we had to give up
further visiting for that day. Among other places we
visited Santa Maria de Carignano, a great church, built by the
munificence of a single Genoese citizen, which crests the
eastern height overlooking the town; and from the terrace
on the top of it there are magnificent views of the entire
panorama&mdash;the harbour, the coast east and west, the city,
and the mountains, which there lay, covered with a coating
of snow, which no doubt had fallen through the night, and
gave a very bleak appearance to the surroundings. I could
gladly have remained up for a long time (the others had
not ventured), but the cold was so great that I could only
take a momentary glimpse. We had also from the opposite
extremity of the town a different view, looking from the
harbour near to the lighthouse upward to Genoa, rising in
crescent form line above line from the basin of the port.
The street itself, which surrounds the port, is for the most
part noisy, bustling, and dirty&mdash;by no means, therefore,
attractive. At some parts the passage is nearly blocked by
loiterers, who may perhaps, by a stretch of charity, be
supposed to be actively prosecuting some busy calling, just
as may be seen on the street of a country town at home on
a market day.</p>

<p class="p2">The following day was dry, but cold, and afforded an
opportunity for going about a little on foot, and seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
some of the large churches and the streets of grand palaces
for which Genoa is famous. These palaces (some of them
now used for purposes other than those for which they
were built) are principally situated in a line of streets,
called the Vias Balbi, Nuova, and Nuovissima. Like those of
many of the Italian towns, these vias are paved with large
flat blocks of stone, neatly, closely, and uniformly laid. The
palaces themselves are massive stone buildings of the
elegant Italian style now so often adopted by our architects
in designing banks and public offices, the walls generally
in rustic work, and the cornices rich and heavily projecting,
the large windows protected from assault by thick
outside iron gratings and stanchions, imparting a very
prison-like look. The palaces are lofty and handsomely
built, and the entry is generally by a large gateway to an
inner court, round which further buildings are placed.
Wide handsome staircases, quite a marked feature, conduct
to the upper floors. The streets which are lined by these
palaces are so narrow that the elegance of design is greatly
lost to the eye. On this the occasion of our first visit, we
had only opportunity of seeing the Palazzo Brignole, which
contains a fine collection of paintings by the great masters
Vandyke, Guido Reni, and others. Among them we
observed a particularly good St. Sebastian by Guido. In
the following year we visited some additional palaces,&mdash;viz.,
first, the Palazzo Durazzo on the Via Balbi, a magnificent
house with a much-noted staircase. Notwithstanding the
family were then residing in this palace, we were shown
through about a dozen rooms, in which the hangings were of
superb elegance, and the walls richly adorned with pictures.
Thence we went to the Palazzo Balbi, a fine mansion, but
not equal to the Durazzo; and thence to the Palazzo Reale,
one of those royal palaces which the King of Italy seldom
visits, but which he nevertheless appears compelled to
maintain. The rooms are beautiful, the queen’s bedroom
particularly rich and dazzling. The facilities afforded for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
seeing these palaces, which no one going to Genoa should,
if possible, omit to visit, are very commendable. A fee of
1 franc to the attendant is all that there, as elsewhere in
Italy, is expected.</p>

<p class="p2">The churches of Genoa are, like all Italian churches, very
dark and very dirty&mdash;purposely ill-lighted, no doubt, to
produce a dim religious light, and dirty because it is part
of an Italian’s religion in church to spit upon the floor and
otherwise to consider that cleanliness is next to ungodliness.
The Cathedral of San Lorenzo and the neighbouring Jesuit
Church of San Ambrogio are large buildings, especially
the cathedral, and possess fine altars, surmounted by show
pictures, and otherwise are richly adorned. The Church of
San Annunciata, on the way to the railway station, is
profusely gilded.</p>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon we walked to the Aqua Sola, a public park,
which is evidently a place of resort of the Genoese gentry.
Being a winter day, there were not many going about; but
we saw a number of handsome equipages with Italian
horses, their long flowing tails touching the ground. A very
curious kind of curricle, such as we saw nowhere else, was
constructed with high wheels, and seated, like a country
mail cart, for one person only. This was drawn by one
horse at full speed, and between two of them a race was
run round and round the park. We had seen a good many
of the women walking about town, having a mantilla or
veil depending from the head&mdash;a graceful Genoese fashion,
although one would hardly think it could afford much
protection from either cold or heat. But here, for the first
time, we saw some of the grand Italian nurses, who are
generally dressed in a most peculiar and magnificent attire,
their hair fantastically decked with large pins, very
gorgeous to behold. There were evident degrees of magnificence,
dependent, I suppose, to some extent upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
condition of the family in whose service the nurses were.
The children also in their charge were attired in costumes
more or less brilliant and rich, everything in Genoa being, I
presume, from a palace to a hair-pin, necessarily ‘superb.’</p>

<p class="p2">Next morning we resolved to proceed to Spezia, but
before going, drove out to the famous Campo Santo. It
is situated about a mile and a half out of town, and the
road to it is by no means choice; but the place itself is
remarkable. The cemetery covers a good many acres of
ground, and, judging from the inscriptions on the tombs, is
little more than a quarter of a century old; but the mode
in which it is laid out is peculiarly Italian. It was the
first of the kind I had seen. We subsequently visited
others in different parts of Italy; but there was not one
which could be compared, for combined grandeur and tasteful,
refined elegance, with that of Genoa. The main portion
of the grounds is laid out in a large square, enclosing a
piece of open ground, probably, speaking roughly and from
recollection, six or eight acres in extent. This open ground
apparently is used for the more common burials, and is in
no way extraordinary, except for the contrast it affords to
the enclosed portions. The monuments, thickly planted in
it, are of the paltry, frippery kind,&mdash;little tumble-down,
uneasy-looking crosses, gewgaw wirework, top-heavy
miniature lanterns pending from poles agee,&mdash;mingled
with tawdry remains of immortelles and withered flowers,
so commonly seen in Roman Catholic grounds abroad,
though, to do the Genoa burying-ground justice, it is much
more tidy in this respect than is customary. A colossal
statue of the Virgin stands in the centre of the open space.
Round three sides of this ground (besides the fourth
regarding which anon) there have been built, in white
marble,&mdash;of which material there are quarries in the
neighbourhood of Genoa,&mdash;two long, parallel, spacious enclosures
or vaults. In the outer of these vaults, monumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
tablets are ranged down the side walls row above row in
great uniformity, recording the names (with usual dates) of
the deceased persons who have been, or are presumed to
have been, buried in cells of which these are the outer ends
or sides. The tablets are all of white polished marble, and
black lettered. There is nothing particularly striking about
this part except its extent and, to our eyes, novelty. But the
inner aisle or arcade and all the corners or prominent parts
are devoted to statues and figures, and sometimes representations
in <i>alto relievo</i>&mdash;all cut out of white marble, and erected
in memory of the more eminent or more opulent citizens of
Genoa, or members of their families, who are buried there.
The monuments evidence possession not merely of the
beautiful material out of which they are produced, but of
great natural capability on the part of the Italian sculptors,
and of a taste on the part of the public, either natural or
educated, in that direction. Without according indiscriminate
admiration, one may say that there was scarcely
a piece of sculpture of which our best artists at home could
reasonably be ashamed. On the one side of each arcade
the memorials are, for the most part, mural; on the other,
which opens by arches to the Campo, the principal monuments
are placed one under each arch. The general
character of the mural monuments is stately repose, some
exceptionally being in action. But under the arches,
between the supporting columns, the figures are often in
startling resemblance to life. For example, one group is of
a lady sitting up in bed, with an earnest fascinating or
fascinated look, grasping the right hand of another in a long
garment, loose from the neck to the feet, whose left arm
and forefinger of the hand are pointing upward. In another,
a charming female figure appears soaring with an angel
upward resting on clouds, the group being pervaded, like
so many more, by a marvellous grace and freedom of execution.
Another is a mother with a babe in each arm.
But it would be endless to describe them, the more especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as to do so effectively one would require to make each
monument a special study&mdash;not to be recommended, because
the vaults are cold, and it is not safe to linger in them.
Only the west of the three sides of the quadrangle, and part
of the south side, were then so occupied.</p>

<p>The fourth side of the square lies upon the slope of a
hill, and advantage has been taken of this natural feature
of the ground for the formation of terraces, in the centre of
which, at the top of a magnificent flight of marble steps, a
large circular church of white marble has been built, upon
entering which we look upon a majestic row of black
marble pillars, standing in a stately circle round vacancy as
yet. When we saw it last, the church was not completed,
and evidently would not be for a long time to come,
for no expense seems to be spared to render it in every
respect the grand complement of its beautiful surroundings.
Upon the arcaded terraces, stretching away right and left
from the church, we found some of the choicest groups of
sculpture in the whole place. They are large and costly,
and harmoniously graceful embellishments of the symmetrical
structure. Behind these arcades, vaults have been
built akin to those on the other three sides; while beyond,
to the north, open ground on the hill-slope has been laid
out for interments,&mdash;as yet sparsely dotted by monuments.</p>

<p class="p2">A burial-place such as this would at home cost such an
enormous amount of money as practically to remove from
our thoughts the possibility of erecting it. I presume it is
only possible in Italy from the circumstance that the
sculptor’s occupation is more common, and is less handsomely
remunerated; but much also is due to the proximity
of the material, and to an appreciation on the part of the
public of the forms of high art. In regarding this wonderful
enclosure, a mingled feeling will in many minds arise;
for its solemn impressiveness, its silent grandeur, its
touching monuments and bas-reliefs, its very unadorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
inscriptions, carry us away in thought and sympathy to sad
scenes of death and sorrow; while the brightness and
purity, and the exquisite forms and seraphic tranquillity of
the sculptured white marble, point to that beatific life
beyond the tomb, where all is bright and pure and exceeding
lovely&mdash;where the spirits of just men made perfect, in
serene, undisturbed calm, dwell for ever in the rapture of
heavenly joy, and, arrayed in the beauty of holiness, are
surpassing glad amidst the burning thrill of boundless love
and the celestial beams of ineffable glory, and the sweet
music of angel song&mdash;for, they stand in the presence of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>SPEZIA, PISA, SIENNA.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> had to hurry away from the Campo Santo to get
money changed, prepare for travelling, and be in time for
the train at half-past one. When we reached the hotel, we
found there were about forty leaving by the same train.
We were therefore advised to take the first omnibus, but
it involved waiting an hour in the cold <i>salle-d’attente</i> at
the station. I had taken at Nice, Cook’s tickets from
Genoa to Rome, with a potentiality of stopping at three
places by the way; so that all I had to do was to get the
tickets marked for Spezia, our first stoppage, and stamped
for the commencement of the journey, and to get luggage
weighed and paid for. The trouble saved by taking these
tickets was, I found, so insignificant that I never afterwards
procured them.</p>

<p class="p2">The railway journey (57 miles) from Genoa to Spezia is
very tantalizing. It takes three hours, including stoppages,
and in that time we passed through thirty-eight tunnels.
The line is close to the sea, and the views or peeps throughout
of ocean, rock, and village are lovely and picturesque,
the many small coast towns by the way being brightly
Italian in their character. We had scarcely time, however,
to enjoy any scene when the view was suddenly cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
off by a long tunnel, the same thing to happen time after
time provokingly. It is said that the tunnels, which
must have rendered the railway a very costly undertaking,
are giving way, and that the line may require to be
abandoned. Be this as it may, to those who would enjoy
the scenery, nothing could be more charming than to drive,
in warm enough weather, by carriage along the Riviera di
Levante, the scenes by road being considered to equal those
of the Riviera di Ponente. Some towns, such as Nervi, in
sheltered situations on the route, are used to some extent
as winter resorts, although comfortable accommodation is
difficult to procure. Even with all the disadvantages
attendant upon travelling by railway, we were greatly
delighted with our journey, the pleasure being much aided,
no doubt, by the brilliant sunshine of the day. And here
I may just observe, that, notwithstanding the drawback of
travelling by rail and passing through so many tunnels,
travellers of the present day are greatly better off than
those of only a few years back, when, in consequence of
the expense and insecurity of proceeding by road, most
people went by sea from Marseilles to Naples, touching at
Genoa and Civita Vecchia by the way. Splendid general
views, doubtless, they sometimes in day-time had; but not
only did the vessels keep too far out of sight of land to
permit of close observation of the lovely coast, but the
voyages appear generally to have been made in great part
by night.</p>

<h3>SPEZIA.</h3>

<p>Spezia, on arrival, appeared beauteous, and, though a
tolerably large town, quite rural after Genoa. We drove to a
large new hotel, the Croce di Malta, the omnibus entering the
hall of the hotel itself, which we found to be spacious, with
long flights of stairs and lofty ceilings, and profusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
white marble,&mdash;in fact, the use of marble for some purposes
might well enough have been dispensed with. However,
Spezia is a summer and not a winter place, and these cool
appearances must be very grateful to the summer visitors.
The Genoese largely resort to it in summer months, and I
suppose the sea-bathing obtained at its beach is excellent.
During our visit the weather was intensely cold, and we
had the utmost difficulty in heating our lofty rooms with
fires of a soft wood which rapidly burnt down. But what
was thus a source of discomfort, added a charming effect to
the landscape. Snow had fallen, and the Carrara Mountains
(some of them between 5000 and 6000 feet high),
which are seen from Spezia, lying to the south, were
covered with a mantle whiter, perhaps, than the white
marble they contain, ranges of hills and mountains of a
lower height in their own green clothing lying between.
Add to this fine effect the splendid harbour to which
nature has so much contributed, containing the great
arsenal of Italy, and the bay filled with large men-of-war,
at one time riding at anchor, at another steaming about in
order to exercise their crews, the handsome many-storied
ranges of buildings fronting the shore, and behind them the
town with a ruined castle on a height, and rising directly
in the north a huge protecting wall of high mountains, and
the panoramic picture is complete. A London artist who
was there at the time (Mr. Pilleau), and whom we afterwards
met at almost every place which we visited in Italy, made
a drawing in colours of the scene, with the Carrara Mountains
in the background; and I do not think that there was
among all his Italian drawings, which he subsequently
kindly showed us, one which had a finer pictorial effect.</p>

<p class="p2">We arrived on the Saturday. English service was held
in a room of the hotel on the Sunday, and was well
attended in the forenoon; but, in accordance with a too
common laxity of practice, few attended in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
The Monday was a warmer day, and we enjoyed a ramble
and ascended the hill lying to the back of the town, from
which we had a grand view of the Gulf of Spezia, which
is a tongue of sea running up northward from the Mediterranean,
and studded by islands at the entrance. A delightful
drive may be had to Porto Venere (more charming when
leaves are out), but we did not feel it sufficiently warm to
hazard the exposure.</p>

<p>It would undoubtedly have been a gratification to have
seen the arsenal and the large 100-ton gun, but we were
informed that it was necessary to obtain from Rome a
permission to see them, and this difficulty put it beyond
our power.</p>

<p class="p2">We remained three nights at Spezia, and on Tuesday
morning left for Pisa, the weather having again become raw
and cold.</p>

<p>The journey to Pisa occupied about four hours. We
passed many interesting places, and among others the
Carrara quarries. Immense quantities of the white marble,
quarried from the hills adjoining the railway, lay at the
stations ready for transport. The quarrying of this famous
marble, the purer quality of which is of close grain (the
fine statuary marble), is a source of employment to a vast
number of workmen. When the traveller has time to
spare, it is no doubt worth stopping a few hours between
trains to visit the place. At last we arrived in sight of
Pisa, and as we entered the town got a glimpse from the
carriage windows of the buildings which have made it
celebrated.</p>

<h3>PISA.</h3>

<p>The weather was cold, and lunch hardly helped to warm
us, so we speedily set out to get a brisk walk and see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
lions. We had hardly emerged from the door of the Hotel
de Londres when we were waylaid by one of the loitering
guides. We could not shake him off, and engaged him at
3 francs. He proved of little use beyond taking us the
most direct route to the objects in view by a handsome
bridge over the Arno, which is probably from 300 to 400
feet wide; but it was then in full flood, the snow melting
on the mountains bringing down much water. Proceeding
up a long street, we came at the end of it, on the outskirts
of the town, to the Piazza del Duomo, where are congregated
all that may be said to make Pisa famous in the world&mdash;its
cathedral, its baptistery, its Campo Santo, and its leaning
tower. Here we stood face to face with what had been
familiar to me through pictures from boyhood as ‘the
seventh wonder of the world.’ Whether it be the seventh
or the seventieth wonder of the world, I don’t know, but it
was with a strange feeling I thus for the first time saw the
reality. The day was too cold to venture the ascent to the
top, from which there is an extensive view. Controversy
exists as to whether the fact of the inclination is due to
design or to subsidence of the ground. I think the latter
is the real or more likely cause, the more especially as to
all appearance the baptistery also is off the vertical. The
bell tower or Campanile (178 feet high) is one of those
detached belfries not uncommon in Italy, and of which few
specimens occur in England. A rather uneasy feeling is
produced in hearing the bells ring, and thinking of the
vibration to which doubtless the motion subjects a building
which seems as if ready of itself to topple over. We were
glad to take refuge from the cold in the cathedral, constructed
of marble, and eight hundred years old. Unfortunately,
the sun being under cloud, we could not see it to the
same advantage as if it had been a clear day. In length it
exceeds 300 feet. The transept is over 250 feet. The
interior, divided into aisles by double rows of columns,
is a wonderful collection of enrichment of all kinds&mdash;pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
statuary, carved marble, bronzes, articles in gold
and silver, and finely-ornamented pulpits and altars.
We afterwards saw many cathedrals and churches in Italy,
but none to compare with this cathedral in its peculiar
description of magnificence. St. Peter’s of Rome and St.
Mark’s of Venice have their own distinguishing characteristics
entitling them to the first rank, but the Cathedral of
Pisa is just as much worthy of honour in its own line for
what it contains.</p>

<p class="p2">From the cathedral we stepped across the piazza to the
baptistery, where we were so fortunate as to witness two
new-born unhappy infants undergoing the ceremony of
baptism; which, indeed, was rather a serious ordeal, as the
poor little things, not a day old, were well rubbed with oil,
besides being sprinkled with water and tickled with salt.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The priest rattled through the service with great rapidity, the
women uttering the responsive amen at apparently the right
places with promptitude, as if quite accustomed to it. Before
the priest came in, I asked one of the women what was to be
the name. ‘Would you give it?’ was the reply. The building,
thus detached from the church like the Campanile
(of which other specimens occur in Italy), is circular, 100
feet in diameter, surmounted by a dome 190 feet high. It
is an exquisite piece of workmanship, the font and pulpit
being peculiarly rich; the sculpture outside is also good.
Within the building there was a great ring of sound or
hollow echo when the priest read the service.</p>

<p class="p2">Leaving the baptistery, we rung the bell at the door of
the Campo Santo, and were admitted. It is small in size
compared with that at Genoa, and of a very different description
and interest. Its age is great, about seven hundred
years having passed since it was founded. In shape it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
parallelogram, probably about 400 feet long by about 150
feet wide. The walls are covered with curious frescoes,
some of which are getting indistinct. Round the enclosure
and by the walls, under cover, many fine monuments in
marble, old and new, mingled together, are disposed more like
objects in a museum than as forming memorials in a place
of sepulture. The interior court or burial-ground is said to
have been made up of earth (fifty-three ship-loads) brought
from Mount Calvary or some other place near Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="p2">In returning to town, we saw many shops filled attractively
with Italian sculpture in alabaster and in Carrara
marble. Alabaster, however, is soft, and is more liable
to injury than marble, the groups in which material are
much dearer, but at the same time fairly moderate compared
with prices at home, although in computing price the risk
and expense of carriage have to be added.</p>

<p>The town of Pisa is situated upon both sides of the Arno;
the streets, wide and lined with high houses and other
buildings, look tidy and clean; but about all there is a
deserted look, although the population is stated at 50,000,
and the place, which is a University town, is compactly
built. It has a mild humid atmosphere, said, rightly or
wrongly, to have curative properties for those affected with
asthma. Centuries ago it was a leading commercial city,
the great rival of Genoa, with which it was long at war,
and to which it ultimately succumbed. Merchants had not
at that time learnt that their true power and proper glory
lies not in war but in commerce.</p>

<p class="p2">The next day was fine, with a bright sun to warm the
air; and we took advantage of it to drive to Lucca, said in
guide-books to be fifteen miles distant by rail: by road it
seemed little more than ten. Calculating according to
Bædeker, we should only have had, by time occupied (six
hours), to pay 6 francs for the carriage; but the driver asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
15 francs, and agreed to go for 12½ which we were
informed was ample fare. On return he wished us to go by
some other route, and if we had agreed, it would, we were
told, have enabled him to make his own terms at the end
of the drive. The road to Lucca is well-formed, hard, and
level, and would therefore seem to have been one of the old
Roman roads, the more especially as it lies between what
were two ancient Roman cities. It was a most delightful
drive through many picturesque valleys, and through a
mountainous country, and it would have been more so two
months later. At this time the trees were bare. On the
way, near Ripafrata, a bold, steep rock rises like an island
from the plain, crowned by a small Italian town, which our
driver named Lugliano&mdash;a very striking object, especially
with the snow-capped Apennines peering in the background
over the nearer hills, quite an artist’s study,&mdash;and of which,
stopping the carriage for a few minutes, I made a rapid
sketch. As a characteristic specimen of ‘a city set upon
a hill,’ of which we afterwards saw so many in Italy, the
drawing is given in illustration. Lucca is a fortified town,
in regular wall and ditch formation, three miles in circuit,
and there is a good deal to see in it. We visited the
cathedral, and walked round a portion of the ramparts, from
which views are had towards the mountains which surround
Lucca.</p>

<p class="p2">There are two routes from Pisa to Rome&mdash;one by
Leghorn and the coast, which would have obliged us either
to stop the night at the uninviting town of Civita Vecchia,
or to have arrived at Rome late in the evening. We chose the
other route by Sienna. To go by Sienna, the traveller proceeds
eastward about half-way along the railway to Florence,
and changes carriages at Empoli. From Empoli the railway
strikes off southward to Sienna and Rome. Sienna stands
high, being 1330 feet above the level of the sea, and is
considered a place of summer residence for its coolness.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill271" id="ill271">ill271</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">A CITY SET UPON A HILL,<br />ON ROAD TO LUCCA.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I was therefore somewhat apprehensive, considering the cold
weather we had endured, lest it might be too cold. Although,
however, it stands high above the level of the sea, it does
not seem to be more than 200 feet above the level of the
surrounding country, or of the railway, and we did not find
it very cold. But a change had taken place in the weather,
and it was again a fine cloudless day. Having decided to
go by Sienna, we could not resist making another excursion
to the cathedral before starting by the mid-day train, and
were all but tempted to ascend the Campanile. But to an
invalid it looked chilly outside, and the height deterring;
and I being the only one who might have gone, the custodier
could not take me alone, the rule, to guard against accidents
or suicide, being that not less than three must make
the ascent at a time. The cathedral looked much finer in
the sunshine, and we could have lingered long examining it
in detail, and would gladly have had there the wearisome
time, well-nigh an hour, we were, according to Italian custom,
required to spend in the <i>salle-d’attente</i> of the railway. The
journey from Pisa to Sienna, about seventy miles, is through
a mountainous country, with some places of interest by the
way, though our prospect was much contracted by reason of
a passenger in the carriage who would draw down all the
blinds on his side and read a book the whole way, till his
wife, out of shame, seeing our disappointment, persuaded
him to allow one of the three blinds on his side to be
raised, there being no sun peering in even to justify an excuse,
which, indeed, never was made. In four hours and twenty
minutes we arrived at our destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">SIENNA.</h3>

<p>Sienna, resting on the top and brow of a hill, looks
picturesque from below. The railway station lies in a
hollow, and the road up to town is steep. We drove to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the Grand Hotel, which, though not mentioned in Bædeker,
unless its name has been changed, is in by far the best
situation of any, its windows looking down upon the public
park and across to the fort or citadel; while, to add to its
attractions, it is kept by a worthy English landlady, and is
consequently possessed of all English comforts. We had
an hour to see the town before dinner, at which we enjoyed
its famous Chiante wine presented in flasks.</p>

<p class="p2">The following morning, having engaged a guide from the
hotel, we desired him to take us to the places of most
interest. Accordingly, he led us through the long, narrow
main street of Sienna, where there is scarcely room for two
carriages to pass, and no footways, and all paved, according
to Italian mode, with large flagstones. There are shops in
this street, and, I think, nowhere else, but of a very inferior
description. It terminates near the Collegio Tolomei, which
we entered to see a large gallery of the old masters, including
some good paintings, one especially by Perugino. From
this we proceeded to the cathedral, which is built in alternate
courses of black and white marble, the façade very
richly ornamented. The interior, though highly adorned, is
not so rich in works of art as the Cathedral of Pisa. The
interior pavement, composed of marble mosaics, representing
Old Testament scenes, had unfortunately been so much
worn by the worshippers’ feet as to require to be boarded
over for protection; but a part of the boarding is removed,
to allow the visitor to see a portion as a specimen. We
were shown into the library, which is surrounded by huge
illuminated tombs, some of which lie open for inspection.
It is a great lofty hall, ornamented by sculpture and by large
frescoes, executed by a fellow-pupil of Raphael, his great
master having been said to have had a hand in the designs.
These frescoes are very bright and perfect, and were among
the best we saw anywhere in Italy. Leaving the cathedral,
and just looking in at the baptistery below, we crossed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to the large open place called the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele.
Here a curious sight met our eyes. A dentist, who had
been driving through the town in a carriage and four, with
a band of music to congregate the people, stood on the box
of the carriage among a crowd of people, and was gratuitously
extracting their decayed teeth as fast as the unfortunates
could pass up to him. The patient was seated,
a moment’s inspection, the tooth (probably the right one,
not impossibly occasionally the wrong one) was drawn and
tossed into the air among the crowd; the person so operated
on descended, relieved, on the other side, and in a twinkling
another unhappy one took his place to be similarly treated.
We understood that the operator was paid from some
charitable source.</p>

<p class="p2">Several public buildings are situated in the Piazza, and
among them the town or public hall, containing many
frescoes and paintings, through which we were conducted.
A very high, slender-looking tower or campanile rises from
it, and is one of the most prominent objects in Sienna.
Leaving the town-hall, we walked to the Instituto delle Belle
Arti, which contains a collection of old paintings, particularly
of the school of Sienna, principally interesting to the
student; thence to the large Church of St. Domenico,
where are various paintings, and among others, frescoes by
Sodoma.</p>

<p class="p2">The places which we thus visited were among the principal
in the town, and they showed that several days might
profitably be spent by students and lovers of art at Sienna.
Returning to the hotel to lunch, we afterwards crossed the
esplanade or public park to the citadel, and enjoyed the
views of the surrounding country from the battlements.
The walls are high, with deep fosses. I think it was here
for the first time we saw the Italian soldiery; and besides
those stationed in the fort, there was a large force in barracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
outside the walls, in front of which the soldiers were
being drilled. The Italian soldier is of small stature, generally
young or even boyish-looking, as if newly conscripted.
The uniform&mdash;a curious mixture of hot and cold attire&mdash;is
a blue cloth surtout, and white canvas trousers and gaiters,
with a black-glazed, round, broad-brimmed hat, adorned
with a bunch of cock’s feathers, and stuck upon the one
side of the head&mdash;a most unmilitary and unbecoming
head-gear. The undress, a cap covered with white canvas,
is an improvement.</p>

<p class="p2">The following morning we left for Rome. There is not
much of interest by the way, unless it be that the railway
runs by the river Tiber more than half the journey; but as
we approached our destination, we strained our eyes in eager
longings to catch the first view of the glorious old place.
Rome, however, is not imposing at a distance. Almost the
only object which catches the eye is the dome of St. Peter’s.
At length we passed slowly through the Campagna, skirted
an ancient aqueduct and some other ruins, entered the walls
of the fortifications, and in a modern railway station were
deposited in the grand old Eternal City.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>ROME.</i></p>


<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> had about a month previously taken rooms in Madame
Tellenbach’s Pension for the 15th of March, but at her
suggestion, as the weather had been cold and wet, had given
them up. We obtained quarters in the Hotel de Londres,
on the opposite side of the Piazza di Spagna. This is a
large open space, in what is considered to be the strangers’
quarter, and most of the principal hotels are in it, or in
its neighbourhood. It is very necessary to be cautious
where one sleeps in Rome, and we heard that cases of fever
had happened even in some of what are considered the best
hotels. It is said that it is not desirable to have rooms
immediately under the Pincian Hill; while, oddly enough
also, it is believed that the most healthy localities are those
in which the houses and their inhabitants are most crowded,
as in the Ghetto. I cannot vouch for either of these
theories. After being two nights in the Hotel de Londres,
we procured rooms in Madame Tellenbach’s. There are some
advantages attaching to a house of this description in a
place like Rome; principally because the people mingle
more sociably together than in an hotel, arising, I suppose,
from the lady of the house sitting at table and introducing
her guests to each other. It is also less expensive than an
hotel. It cost me from 4 to 5 francs per day for each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
my party more at the hotel than at the pension, the difference
necessarily being more or less according to circumstances,
and especially according to the rooms taken in the
one and in the other. But it must be admitted that there
is a certain amount of additional comfort, tidiness, and
appearance, which are usually obtained at an hotel, which
a little judicious expenditure in a pension might secure.
And for a short visit the hotel is, in any view, preferable.</p>

<p>Those who intend to spend the winter in Rome can, if
they so desire, procure lodgings; and sometimes they can
be obtained at a moderate rate. A friend had (winter
1878-79) for six months a suite of rooms (two public and
three bed rooms) neatly furnished, in a good street near the
Piazza di Spagna, for 320 francs per month, service included.
The rooms, however, were on the fourth <i>piano</i> or
storey, and on a lower floor would have been greatly more.
But in Rome, as in Italian towns generally, it is an advantage
to be high up; and, indeed, one may toil up a long
stair, as we have done, and find an excellent private dwelling
on the top floor; for many of the houses in Rome
resemble the ‘tenements’ or ‘lands’ so common in Scotland,
divided into ‘flats,’&mdash;that is, a separate dwelling on
each floor, and communicating with the street by a common
stair.</p>

<p class="p2">The Piazza di Spagna is a very convenient central position
for all parts of Rome, and it is filled with carriages for
hire&mdash;both landaus with two horses, and little carriages with
one horse, principally the latter. None of the horses look
very strong, but they go actively about. Carriage fares
are moderate, a course in a one-horse carriage being 80
centimes, with 20 centimes extra for each passenger beyond
two; nor is <i>buono mano</i> (drink money) expected. Per
hour, the charge is 1 franc 70 centimes for one horse, and
2 francs 20 centimes for two (scarcely 2s.). It is well
that fares are so moderate, because Rome is a place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
people are cautioned not to fatigue themselves by much
walking.</p>

<p class="p2">We were fortunate enough to get into good genial
weather, with the exception of an occasional shower, and
remained in Rome at this time for nine or ten days, when
we went to Naples, and on our return spent about a fortnight
longer. Both visits combined made but a short period
in which to see all that is to be seen in Rome; but we did
see (in a general way) a great deal in that time, which it
would be impossible for me to describe fully in small compass.
My object here is not to describe in detail, or to
furnish the information which may be had in guide-books,
or in more important works, and particularly in such books
as Hare’s <i>Walks in Rome</i>, which is a most exhaustive guide
to all that can be seen, or Sir George Head’s <i>Rome, A
Tour of Many Days</i>, which, in three volumes, furnishes very
full accounts of everything; it is simply to give a mere
outline of some places we saw, so as to offer a general idea
of them, and be as hints to those who visit the old city.
Photographs and engravings have made all the important
objects familiar to the eye.</p>

<p>Some people set about the seeing of sights in Rome in a
very methodical, systematic manner, and so as to ensure their
missing nothing, planning minutely each night what is to
be done next day. This exhaustive method of ‘doing’
Rome is calculated rather to make a toil of a pleasure; but
some degree of pre-arrangement is necessary, so as to economize
time and to see as much as possible without weariness.
Having decided where to go, we usually after breakfast
engaged a carriage by the hour, or, if desirous of seeing a
gallery of paintings or a palace, which would consume an
hour, drove to the place, dismissed the cab, and on leaving
took the first vacant one at the door. In the city itself
there is no difficulty in at once procuring one anywhere.
But in the outskirts they are not so easily found. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
difficulty happened once to ourselves, on occasion of visiting
St. John in Lateran. Having in view to see the church,
museum, baptistery, Santa Scala, and other neighbouring
places, which would take at least two hours, we unluckily
dismissed our carriage, and when we left had to walk
some distance before obtaining another to take us back to
town.</p>

<p class="p2">Our first day in Rome was a Sunday. We readily found
the Presbyterian or Scotch church just outside the Porto
del Popolo. It is a large, airy, nice place of worship. The
climate of Rome, however, does not suit every one, and may
produce weakness or develop what is latent. We met at
Mentone, in the following winter, an esteemed Scotch
clergyman, who ascribed debility to having in a previous
year had three months’ duty in Rome. He had never, he
said, been in good health since.</p>

<p class="p2">Next morning we drove to St. Peter’s, which is generally
the first object of attraction to the visitor. The way to it
leads through narrow insignificant streets till the Ponte St.
Angelo be reached. This bridge across the Tiber is decorated
on each side parapet with five white marble statues,
looking very black with exposure to the weather. The
Tiber rolls below, yellow, muddy, and unalluring, and is in
breadth between 300 and 400 feet, or about one-third the
width of the Thames at Blackfriars Bridge.</p>

<p>The Castle of St. Angelo is one of those marked features
of old Rome which engravings enable us at once to recognise.
It was built by Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself
and succeeding emperors, and the square base of this
immense monument covered an acre and a half of ground.
The round tower, which rises from the base, is now 188 feet
in diameter; but it is stripped of its outer case of stone and
white marble, and it no longer possesses what it is believed
to have had, a dome 300 feet high, together with encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
statues. When built, it was no doubt a monument of the
greatest magnificence; but its massive strength caused it
to be for centuries occupied as a fort, and the successive
sieges to which it has been subjected have brought about
the destruction of all its adornment. Its history is to a
large extent, since it was built, the history of the city of
Rome, and may be seen set forth in Mr. Storey’s <i>Castle of
St. Angelo</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">Passing the castle on the right, the Tiber being on the
left after crossing the bridge, the way lies along one of
several narrow streets terminating in the great Piazza San
Pietro, so that till the Piazza be reached St. Peter’s
is obscured. It was not without emotion we arrived in
view of this noble building, sending out from it on each
side, like huge arms, imposing colonnades, consisting of no
less than 284 columns each 64 feet high, which enclose so
far the Piazza. The Egyptian obelisk brought to Rome by
Caligula has been placed in the centre of the Piazza, attaining,
with its pedestal, a height of 127 feet 6 inches, and
yet dwarfed in presence of the great temple, the dome of
which, however, is not well seen from the Piazza, or, indeed,
from any place near. The obelisk is flanked on each side
by a large and handsome fountain always playing, and in
windy weather sending a shower of spray to a considerable
distance leeward.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at the bottom of the long flight of steps
which led up to the grand portico, and ascending it, we
passed through, and pushing aside the heavy mat which, as
usual in Italian churches, depends upon the door, looked
eagerly in, and were&mdash;must I confess it?&mdash;at first disappointed.
One expects a great deal, and the magnitude of the building
at first sight did not strike us as so overwhelming. I
suppose this was partly owing to its admirable proportions;
but when we had walked round the interior, the vastness
of the structure seemed to grow upon us, and with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
successive visit we felt its solemn grandeur and majestic
harmony impressing more and more. We contented ourselves
on the present occasion with walking round, Bædeker
in hand, studying the plan, and making ourselves familiar
with the different parts. St. Peter’s drew us to it repeatedly
afterwards, and as this is not a journal of visits, I may here
simply notice the result of the impressions which we
formed.</p>

<p class="p2">This grand edifice, the largest church in Christendom, is
in every respect on a colossal scale. There is nothing
paltry about it, unless it be the statue of St. Peter himself.
This is frightfully hideous, and why it should have been
allowed to be set and to remain in a place where everything
is in such good taste, is very extraordinary. The
statue is a sitting one, bolt upright, and holding up two
fingers of the right hand in a stiff manner. The face is
ugly, and certainly has not anything of the Jewish type
about it. Every minute people are seen coming up to kiss
the toe of this odious image, the kissing being performed
by all classes of people. I observed how inconsistent it
was with the character of the apostle, who, with all his
forwardness, had a profound consciousness of his own sinful
humanity, and who himself, when ‘Cornelius fell down at
his feet and worshipped him, took him up, saying, Stand up,
I myself also am a man.’ A story goes that a person
affected with sore eyes had gone up and rubbed them upon
the toe, and immediately afterwards a gentleman, ignorant
of this remedial operation, coming in, kissed it. Let us
hope he was straightway informed by some charitable onlooker
of what had previously been done, and that the fact
opened his eyes to the grossness of such superstitious
idolatry. It is strange that Peter should be forced into
association with Rome, because, as those who have anxiously
investigated the subject consider, there is no actual proof
of the ‘first’ (called) of the apostles ever having been there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
And yet in the Mamertine prison, the place is shown where
it is given out that Peter and Paul were imprisoned; and so
far do they presume on credulity, that a hollow in the wall
is actually pointed out and gravely affirmed to have been
made upon it by contact with the energetic apostle’s head,
I suppose during animated discussions with Paul. If I am
not mistaken, it was Adam Smith who left the mark of his
head on the wall paper of the room in which he wrote his
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>; but Peter’s head must have been formed
of stuff harder and rougher even than that of his statue, to
have hollowed out a hole in a stone wall. A more wonderful
stone, however, is shown in a little chapel outside the
gates, fixed on the floor, where we were gravely informed,
for the charge of, I think, 5 soldi (twopence halfpenny),
that the deep impression of two feet&mdash;pretty large ones too&mdash;were
the marks of Peter’s feet. This marvellous petrifaction
is protected by an iron grating.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> To crown all, the
dome of St. Peter’s is held to cover the site of the burial-place
of the apostle, and beneath lies his tomb. Over the
supposed tomb and over the high altar attached, at which
only a pope or a cardinal delegate can officiate on important
occasions, a canopy (<i>baldacchino</i>) rises ninety-five feet high,
to which, architecturally, exception has been taken. More
exception might be taken to the reality of the place of
sepulture. It cannot even be proved that Peter was put
to death at Rome, and is it likely that his persecutors
would allow him to be buried in the spot alleged, or that
any succeeding emperor, supposing he was desirous of
removing the martyr to a place with which he, the apostle
of the Jews, had no peculiar connection, would have been
able to have recovered and identified the body?</p>

<p class="p2">The grand central aisle of the cathedral is flanked by
colossal columns, the size of which can hardly be appreciated
without actual measurement or veritable comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
other known heights. On each side the aisles, of proportionate
size, contain large chapels, one of which is used for
the ordinary services of the Church, which are chanted by
the pope’s choir. Gigantic statues and monuments of
popes adorn the aisles and transept. The altars, as usual,
are enriched by paintings, which at our first visit, being in
Lent, were, as in all the churches at that season, veiled.
The altars themselves are rich, but not obtrusively so&mdash;all
in quiet keeping with the august building. In the transept,
wooden confessional boxes are set, each different confessing
nation, England included, having one. Looking up the
gigantic dome, we find the walls covered with mosaics.
The four Evangelists occupy a first course, and high above
them other figures.</p>

<p>Once a week, Thursday mornings, before ten o’clock, the
public are admitted to ascend the dome, which, to the top
of the lantern, is 403 feet high, the extreme height at
the summit of the cross being 435 feet. The ascent, which
can be made on horseback to the roof, is extremely interesting,
and gives a better idea of the magnitude of the building
than any perambulations below. It is effected by a special
tower situated near the portico. By a gentle slope the
passage rises, winding and winding round this huge tower,
along the sides of which inscriptions, cut in the stone, bear
the names of monarchs who have made the ascent, till, after
a long and wearisome progression, the roof of the cathedral
is reached, and stepping out on it we see its great extent and
the gigantic size of the statues, which, having regard to view
from below, are three times the size of life. Walking across
the roof and mounting a few steps, we enter the dome,
and get into the first gallery which encircles it within.
Even from this elevation, gazing down, the people walking
on the floor below looked like pigmies. At this point we
were brought into proximity to the mosaics, and perceived
the colossal scale upon which they are constructed. The
Evangelists, who look like life-size below, are found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of immense magnitude; and what look like small cherub boys
below, are huge giants, the dimensions of which I would
not venture to name, because in St. Peter’s all computations
by the eye are deceptive, and it is only by referring to
actual measurement that sizes can be safely reckoned. Here
also the width of the dome (178 feet) is observable by
finding what a long walk it is round the gallery. A further
ascent up narrow stairs leads to the second gallery over the
first and inside the dome, and from this gallery everything
below is still more dwarfed. Then, by contracted stairs
between the inner and outer walls of the dome, the lantern
is gained. It would be a dizzy height were it not for the
platform of the roof more immediately below. From this
point an admirable bird’s-eye view of Rome is had. Unfortunately
the day we ascended was gusty and wet with
occasional showers, rendering it undesirable to stand at the
embrasures, and disturbing our view. But we could catch
a glimpse of the lie of the town and its extent, which
appeared less than we had expected to see it. Rome
is compact, and this city, once the mistress of the world,
and said to have in the days of its glory possessed a population
exceeding that of London, does not appear to cover
one-third of the ground on which the city of Edinburgh
stands. The greatest length of the inhabited part seems
to be about 1-¾ miles, its greatest width about the same.
According to the last census, the present population is under
250,000. The town, as now occupied, dates back only to
the end of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The second Sunday we were in Rome was Palm Sunday,
and after an early breakfast we drove to St. Peter’s. A
tedious service kept us waiting about an hour, when the
priests formed in procession and marched to the portal
with palms in their hands. These were blanched palms,
twisted into fantastic shapes, and not, as one would suppose,
of the long natural green branches, which would certainly
have been more suitable. The great door was opened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
half the procession passed through and stood outside, the
remainder standing within. Some form of blessing or other
ceremony took place, and then they all marched back again.
Altogether it was a very poor affair, although, when it used
to be performed by the pope himself, I believe it was more
imposing; but the absence of the pope (Pius <span class="smcap">IX.</span>), who
since 1871 had never appeared in public at this or other
ceremonials, stripped the pageant of its wonted attractions.</p>

<p class="p2">The Vatican adjoins St. Peter’s, and consists of immense
ranges of buildings, said to contain 11,000 chambers. It is
no ornament, architecturally, to the cathedral, upon which
it impinges, the portion seen from the Piazza of St. Peter’s
having too much the appearance of a huge factory. Attached
to it, and seen from some of the windows of the Vatican,
the pope’s garden occupies a large piece of ground, very
stiffly laid out, in which His Holiness can, unincommoded
by the public, who are not admitted to it, take his walks
or drives. Admission to the Vatican is by means of <i>permessoes</i>,
which are procurable through booksellers and
others. To obtain these documents, people are put to
trouble and expense, while it must cost a little to issue
them, and really they seem required without adequate
reason. As the <i>permesso</i> is given up at the door, a fresh
one is necessary at every visit, unless the visitor express
a desire to retain it for use again; when he intimates this
at entering, gets it back at going out, and pays the doorkeeper
1 franc for the privilege. Whatever may be the
object of employing them, it does not save fees, which are
payable at every door which is opened. The doors are very
numerous, but fortunately the fee expected is small&mdash;half
a franc, or even, in some cases, quarter of a franc from each
party suffices for each janitor. These ‘proud porters’ have
no objection to copper. It would be really much better if
all fees and <i>permessoes</i> were abolished and strictly <i>prohibited</i>,
and a fee not exceeding a franc for a party of, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
four were exacted at each visit. The galleries of the
Vatican are places which most people desire, when they go
to Rome, to see over and over again.</p>

<p>The great gate of the galleries, in which the sculptures
are deposited, is reached by driving or walking all round
St. Peter’s; and by making the circuit, although it is rather
long, one obtains another idea of the vast extent and huge
proportions of the cathedral.</p>

<p>The galleries containing the paintings are situated in
other rooms, and require separate days as well as separate
orders for their examination. The entrance is reached by
the Scala Regia in the Colonnade, on the right side approaching
St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>We devoted two separate afternoons to each.</p>

<p>The sculptures are far more numerous than the paintings,
and even after two inspections, we could only consider we
had seen them in a very general way. To do them justice,
one would almost require to bestow upon each different
group of halls a distinct visit. The number of statues,
busts, urns, and other sculptured objects exhibited, is very
great. Most, if not all of them, have been recovered from the
ruins of ancient Rome while under the government of the
popes. The visitor is brought face to face with the original of
the Apollo Belvedere, the Laocoon, and many other statues
and groups familiar to all by copies or by engravings. But
it is necessary to watch carefully, lest omission be made of
some of the rooms; for we discovered, on going a second
time, rooms we had previously overlooked, and which contained
some of the finest statuary. Of many of the halls
and of the individual statues, photographs can be purchased
in the shops, which, to those who have not seen them,
convey some idea of the galleries and their contents, and
are exceedingly useful to those who have, in recalling
them. Without this help, the multiplicity of objects tends
to obscure and confuse the recollection. There is one
annoying feature about the statue galleries of the Vatican,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
that in place of the names of the objects, there is painted
upon them the name of the pope by whom they were
placed where they stand. One gets quite irritated by
the vanity of Pius <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and Pius <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, leading them in so
objectionable a manner to obtrude their names upon the
public.</p>

<p>The examination of the picture galleries is much more
easily accomplished. The good paintings are in reality
confined to two or three rooms, and one or two more, in
which are fine frescoes by Raphael and others. The great
attractions of this gallery are&mdash;’The Transfiguration,’ by
Raphael; ‘The Madonna di Foligno,’ a fine work of the
same great master; and ‘The Communion of St. Jerome,’ by
Domenichino. The upper portion of ‘The Transfiguration’
is so exquisitely beautiful as to suggest whether it would
not have been better severed from the lower half, representing
the writhing boy in the midst of the perplexed
disciples, which, though it may have been designed by
Raphael, was painted by his pupils. Indeed, the insertion
of the scene may be said to be an anachronism, because the
cure was effected on ‘the next day,’ while its introduction
detracts from the feeling of sublime elevation above the
world and the things of the world which the upper portion
of the picture breathes.</p>

<p>There are many other fine pictures in the rooms by the
old masters. One in particular, which struck me for its
softness and beauty of colouring, was a ‘Madonna and Child,’
by Sasso Ferrato, although it must be confessed both the
mother and child are rather plumply fat. I asked the
price of a photograph of it for sale in the rooms, taken from
an engraving, and was asked 4 francs. It is so often
the way in such places to demand long prices.</p>

<p>We had not an opportunity of seeing the library of the
Vatican.</p>

<p>The Sistine Chapel is what nobody omits to see. The
entrance to it is from the Scala Regia, just before coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to the picture galleries. We saw it once, and I must own
it fell short of expectation. The chamber is dark, the
frescoes are fading, and to see some of them it is necessary
to lie on one’s back and look up. The view, therefore, is
indistinct and uncomfortable; but though they are from the
hand of a great master, the eye experiences a want of
repose, the effect of over-decoration.</p>

<p class="p2">It is usually recommended to people visiting Rome for
the first time, to take a preliminary drive of some hours, to
form a general idea of the city. This, after our first visit
to St. Peter’s, we did, and found it attended with considerable
advantage. Except where it is bounded by the
Tiber, Rome is surrounded by walls of defence, in which
are several gates. Outside of some of these gates, the
town has slightly extended; but, for the most part, the
walls stretch a good way beyond the inhabited portion of the
town, which is very compactly built, there being no large
public gardens or parks within the city, and scarcely an
open square, while the streets are narrow and the houses
high. The seven hills upon which Rome has always been
regarded as standing, are rather hillocks than hills, and do
not, seen from the Campagna, bulk much upon the eye.
They vary in height from 156 feet to 218 feet above the
level of the sea; so that, deducting at least 40 feet for the
general level of the city, the highest is but low. From
the Porto del Popolo, outside of which the Protestant
churches are, with one exception, placed, and inside of
which is one of the largest piazzas, or open places, in
Rome, three straight-leading streets branch out, diverging
at acute angles&mdash;viz., the Via Babuino, conducting into
the Piazza di Spagna; a centre street, the famous Via
del Corso; and a third, the Via di Ripetta, which
passes by or near to the banks of the Tiber. All
these streets proceed (a wonderful circumstance in
Rome) in straight lines to a considerable distance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Corso fully a mile in length, the vista of all being
terminated at the one end in the Piazza del Popolo by
the Flaminian Egyptian obelisk, the third in altitude in
Rome. The Corso, the longest and central one, terminates
at a point not far from the forum of Trajan and the
Capitoline Hill, in the vicinity of which the principal ruins
of Rome lie. Out of the Corso, however, except where it
is crossed for a short way after leaving the Porto del
Popolo by a few regular streets, the streets of Rome are so
tortuous that I do not recollect any other city, at least
similar in size, where it is so puzzling to find one’s way
about. I did once or twice adventure on a walk, just to
try and familiarize myself with the streets, but in doing
so found it necessary to take the bearings very exactly,
and to keep the map in hand, to prevent my getting
bewildered. These tortuous streets are irregular and
narrow, sometimes with scarcely room for two little cabs to
pass. They are causewayed, but have no footpath. Even
the three leading streets I have named are extremely
narrow. The Corso is only 40 to 50 feet wide, and the
footpaths which have been placed there are proportionately
contracted, leaving, I may say, no room in some places for
two foot-passengers to pass each other. The streets are
now, however, like other Italian towns, lighted with gas, the
want of proper lighting previously having been much felt.
The principal shops are in the Corso, the Piazza di Spagna,
and the Via Condotti, which crosses from the Corso to the
Piazza. Some of the chief booksellers are in the Piazza,
but the jewellers’ and photographers’ shops are the kind
which are most largely patronized by strangers. None of
the shops, however, are capacious, and the wares they contain
are in general marvellously limited in quantity.</p>

<p class="p2">Beyond the inhabited part of Rome, there are many
good roads, principally conducting to or from the gates,
and leading to the country beyond. As one passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
along the streets, the eye is continually met by churches,
palaces, and other public buildings; but the great attractive
interest lies in what remains of the grand buildings of
ancient Rome, which for the most part are found in
proximity to each other.</p>

<p>Of these, the one which predominates, and by its imposing
mass generally claims the first examination, is the
Colosseum. It stands nearly free from other buildings, in
all the sublimity of age and magnitude. But not far from
it are the Arches of Titus and Constantine, the ruins of the
Temple of Venus, of the Basilica of Constantine, of the
palace of the Cæsars on the Palatine Hill, of the Forum
Romanum, and of many other ancient buildings and places,
familiar to all who have read about Rome, and which one
could not see for the first time without being profoundly
stirred. There are gentlemen&mdash;I suppose they may be
called clinical lecturers&mdash;who give descriptions on the spot of
these interesting old places, and the information so afforded
is useful, because the results of study are imparted by the
living voice in a familiar way, and special attention is
called to the historical associations, which otherwise to
most people might remain unknown. One of these
gentlemen, Mr. Forbes (charge, 3 fr. each), makes up
two parties per day, one before and one after lunch&mdash;regularity
in taking which, in Rome, is always recommended
as essential to health. I had an opportunity on
one occasion of accompanying him, and there was certainly
an advantage in hearing his explanations. There is so
much, however, to see in Rome, and that of a diversified
character, that this was the only time I managed to do so.
Mr. Shakespeare Wood is another who occasionally goes
out in this way, but I was apprised that he would not form
a party during the time we were in Rome. He is said to
be remarkably well informed, and is usually engaged by
Mr. Cook for his special excursions. To those who would
study old Rome, great assistance might be found in a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of instructive papers, evincing great literary research, and
evidently of minute exactness of statement, printed in the
<i>Transactions of the Architectural Institute of Scotland</i>,
written by the late Mr. Alexander Thomson of Banchory.
It would be well if these scholarly papers could be collected
and published by themselves, for, as they stand, they are
not within the reach of the general public. Some of the
statements I shall hereafter make on Old Rome will be on
his authority.</p>

<p class="p2">It would not be possible, according to the plan I have
adopted of a rapid survey of what is to be seen in Rome,
to give any detailed description of the various ancient
buildings, which, besides, are by means of photographs and
engravings so familiar even to those who never have visited
Italy.</p>

<p>The Colosseum<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is an immense mass of building, notwithstanding
not only that it was long occupied as a fortress, and
subjected to the injury resulting from attack and defence,
but that it was, like so many others, used for centuries as a
quarry for its stones, its marble, and even its iron. Happily
this species of destruction was stopped by the French, and
steps have also been taken for its preservation by building
strong and lofty supports. The Colosseum is at least twice
as large as the arena at Nismes, and even as it now remains
it is twice as high,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but that at Nismes is in much better
preservation. The outer walls, galleries, and arches of the
Colosseum are built of massive blocks of stone, bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
together with iron; but brick composed what was below.
Brick, evidently of a hardy quality, cemented by a very
strong, durable mortar, appears, indeed, to have been very
largely used by the Romans for the carcases or substantial
and concealed portions of their buildings. These brick
carcases, however, were either built over with substantial
stone-work, or faced with slabs of marble, sometimes both;
and in a building of this magnitude, even the outer deceptive
covering of stone or marble would be of immense mass. By
the removal of vast quantities of the large stones forming
the casing, a great deal of this brick carcase or underwork
has been laid bare, so that the interior of the building has a
very ruinous look. Externally, also, the removal of courses
of stone, in some parts combined with the ravages of time,
impart to it the aspect of a huge ruin. There is free
entrance to the public to the arena or central area. We
seldom passed the Colosseum without going in to take a
glance at it. One could hardly, however, forget what
deadly scenes had been enacted there, what agonies had
been endured, what cries of pain had been uttered, what
savage shouts had once filled its walls, or help feeling
thankful that the barbarous and brutalizing spectacles which
were then found necessary ‘to make a Roman holiday,’ were
now happily things of a long-past age.</p>

<p>I was so fortunate as to be in the city on Saturday, 21st
April 1877, which was held as the birthday of Rome (the
2630th, I believe), and beheld a spectacle in the Colosseum
which never had greeted the eyes of the old Romans.
Nearly the whole population was, in the evening of that
day, drawn to the great amphitheatre and its neighbourhood.
Joining a party of ladies from our house, with considerable
difficulty we drove through the crowded streets, and, dismissing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the carriage, we succeeded in getting inside the
Colosseum along with a large but orderly mass of people.
After waiting long, we were at last rewarded. All of a
sudden, the various galleries, which I suppose had been
lined with soldiers, were illumined with coloured lights.
On one half of the huge building red lights were burned;
on the other half, green. When the powders were burned
down, others were substituted, the colours being reversed.
The effect was magnificent. Every figure in the place was
bathed in coloured light, while the walls were one mass of
a glowing hue, disclosing the colossal proportions in all
their ruinous irregularity, and, where red was burned, looking
as if it were a huge lump of burning lava or molten iron.
This over, with some trouble we managed to edge away from
the crowd to the outside, to see the further operations elsewhere.
The Colosseum itself was first lighted on the
exterior, which, fine as the effect was, I think could hardly
be compared with the interior view. Lights were then
successively burned to illuminate the Arches of Constantine
and Titus and the Basilica of Constantine&mdash;the figures of
the persons running about in charge appearing at a little
distance, wrapped in the carmine colour, like so many
incarnate demons. Last of all, the Forum, the Capitoline
Hill, and the surrounding buildings and ruins, were several
times similarly illuminated, while a display of fireworks
from the Capitol terminated this very imposing spectacle.</p>

<p class="p2">The grand dimensions of the Colosseum drew us often
there. It seemed at every visit more and more imposing.
Leaving it, and proceeding by the Via Sacra to the
Capitoline Hill, which lies about half a mile distant, one
passes upon the left the Arch of Constantine, standing at
the entrance to a broad wooded roadway, called the Via di
Gregorio, running between the Palatine Hill (on which are
the ruined palaces of the Cæsars) on the right side, and the
Church of San Gregorio Magno and other buildings on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
left side, and leading out towards the Appian Way. The
fine sculptures upon the arch are well preserved, and give
a richer appearance to it than to any other arches now
standing; but have been taken from buildings of an earlier
age than that of Constantine, and thought to be of the time
of Trajan, whose life they illustrate.</p>

<p>About 200 yards farther on we pass under the Arch of
Titus. The bas-relief, exhibiting the triumphal procession
and captive Jews, is of itself sufficient to confer a lasting
interest upon this arch. It forms a grand contemporaneous
record of the siege of Jerusalem, and of the forms of some
of the sacred furnishings of the temple.</p>

<p>Here we find and drive over a portion of the veritable
paving-stones of an old Roman road, the Via Sacra. Considering
how frequently our roads and streets require to be
re-paved, re-laid, or re-macadamized, it seems little short of
a miracle that any portion of the old Roman paving should
have remained for so many centuries. But the Roman
roads were constructed in a special manner, with the great
object in view of ensuring their being solid, dry, level, and
direct. The under foundation was of three courses of
broken stones of different given sizes for each course, and
altogether 3 feet deep, with a top course of closely-jointed
stone, generally basalt, a foot thick. The roads were narrow,
sometimes only 12 feet wide, and had a rise of 3 inches in
the centre to allow the rain to run off. The making of
roads was considered a matter of prime importance and a
most laudable undertaking, so that enormous sums were
spent on them. In Britain alone there were 2500 miles of
Roman roads. The roads of Rome were the more durable,
inasmuch as they were not subjected to the heavy traffic of
our streets, the carriages being small and light; while, as no
gas and water pipes underlay them, there was no everlasting
turning of them up to get at things below, and as little
were there tramway lines to shake the foundations or injure
the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The space of ground on which the Forum Romanum
stands lies on the Colosseum side of the Capitol. It is sunk
many feet below the level of the roads which now surround
it, and which, no doubt, have been so raised above it by the
accumulation of rubbish during centuries. Little is left entire
in this open or excavated space but the Arch of Severus;
the remainder, inclusive <i>inter alia</i> of the once splendid
Basilica Julia, and the temples of Saturn and Vespasian, are
in ruins, only a few pillars remaining to testify to what
they were, and in some cases not even so much. But
enough remains to show how very elegant these buildings
must have been, although one would think, judging from
their present appearance, they were rather too much crowded
together for effect. The whole of the space, however,
between the Capitoline Hill and the Colosseum was at one
time a scene of great magnificence, and all glistening in
white marble. Classic temples and other buildings apart
from the Forum were ranged upon one side, with the
Quirinal and Esquiline Hills, and Trajan’s Forum and Column
in the background; while the other side was bordered by
the Palatine Hill (118 feet above the valley), crowned by
the grand palace of the Cæsars. This is now almost a
mass of ruins, but much excavation has of late years been
made, rendering a visit to it exceedingly interesting. We
spent some hours one day exploring the ground, admission
to which is by payment of one franc each.</p>

<p>The Capitoline Hill, attained from the Forum by two
roads, and covering an area of 16 English acres, is crowned,
as seen from the direction of the Colosseum, with a building
which has little but some age to recommend it, and from
which a square tower rises. It turns its back on the Forum
below. The hill, however, in the time of the old Romans,
was undoubtedly decorated with imposing buildings worthy
of its situation. The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus is now
ascertained to have stood upon the highest part of the hill,
on the site of the present Church of St. Maria in Ara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
C&oelig;li, reached by a very ladder of steps (124 in number)
from the level plateau on the main crown of the hill,
formerly the valley of the Intermontium, now called the
Piazza del Campidoglio. This church dates from the tenth
century, and is the oldest extant in Rome. It is large,
but, though curious, cannot be said to equal many others,
and, I suppose, derives its chief importance from its
association with the miracle-working Bambino, which marvellous
doll finds its abode there. The Capitoline Museum
stands on one side of the Piazza, and the Palace of the Conservatori
on the other. These are modern buildings, but
they contain a large collection of sculptures found in or
about Rome, and a large picture gallery comprehending
many fine paintings by the old masters. One of the
sculpture rooms is devoted to busts of the Roman emperors,
and is considered to be the best collection of them. It is
strange and deeply interesting to look at these marble
representations, executed from the living person, of men who
existed so long ago, and whose actions are so noted in
history. Where there are more than one of the same
man, they invite comparison to notice their accordances
or their dissimilarities. The galleries also comprise many
other objects of great attraction; for example, what is
commonly called ‘The Dying Gladiator,’ which, thus seen
in the original, far excels any copy. Indeed, it is seldom
that copies approach originals. They want the delicate
shades and lines, and other evidences of masterly power
denoting that marked superiority which raises the great
creations of genius above the works of the common
herd. In another room we saw the famous Capitoline
Venus.</p>

<p>In a side street we were shown the place which is held
to have been the site of the Tarpeian Rock, from which
malefactors were hurled; but if this be the true site, the
ground below has been much filled up, as the height seems
little enough for producing so violent a death. Near to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the spot is also pointed out where Tarpeia opened the gate
of the citadel to the Sabines, and received the reward of
her treachery.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Piazza the noble equestrian statue of
Marcus Aurelius arrests the eye. There is a vigorous
power about horse and rider to which no other similar
statue rises. I have felt it impossible to compare with it
the equestrian statue of Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span> at Charing Cross, in
London, or even that of Charles <span class="smcap">II.</span> in the Parliament
Square, Edinburgh, although this last is considered a fine
work of art. A broad, handsome flight of steps conducts to
the town below. Descending a little way, there may be
seen two wolves, kept within an iron-barred cage in memory
of the traditional story regarding Romulus and Remus.</p>

<p>We found not far from the Capitoline Hill the beautiful
little circular Temple of Vesta, which has been made familiar
to everybody by photographs and engravings, and in its
neighbourhood a small part of the Cloaca Maxima. This is
a portion of the great system of drains (either for sewage
or for removing stagnant marsh water) with which Rome
was supplied. There it stands to this day, for everything
with the Romans was not only made adequate to subserve
its purpose, but built to endure, if only the destructive hand
of man would let it alone.</p>

<p class="p2">It would, however, be perfectly endless to attempt to
enumerate, much less describe, all the ancient buildings of
interest in Rome. There are now upwards of twenty temples,
about a dozen triumphal and other arches, and many other
buildings, more or less in a state of ruin. To describe all
these would be beyond the scope of the present work.
But I can hardly, in narrating our visit, omit to advert
to one or two more of the features of Old Rome still
remaining.</p>

<p class="p2">There are scattered over the old city various prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
pillars and obelisks, which naturally attract attention.
The most important of the monumental columns are those
of Trajan and of Marcus Aurelius, and there is also in
the Forum Romanum a small pillar of a different character,
that of Phocas.</p>

<p>The pillar of Trajan is familiar to all by engravings.
The <i>bassi-relievi</i> which encircle it contain no less than
2500 figures of men, besides those of animals and other
objects. It was erected not merely as a monument to the
man, but as a record in its height of the depth of the huge
work of excavation on the Quirinal Hill, undertaken and
accomplished at its site. The sculpture which adorns it is
a beautiful and interesting record of events in Trajan’s
history. The pillar was planted in the middle of a forum,
and surrounded by buildings of such wonderful beauty,
and composed of materials so rich and varied, that those
who beheld them found themselves utterly at a loss for
words to express their admiration; but now, so far as any
remains are extant, altogether in ruins, while the rest has
been built over.</p>

<p>The column of Marcus Aurelius in the Piazza Colonna,
is a similar though less perfect structure.</p>

<p class="p2">But the obelisks in Rome are more remarkable than
the columns. When we think of the difficulty we have
recently had in removing to London a single obelisk, and
that not of the largest size, it seems incredible to hear,
notwithstanding Rome is so much nearer Egypt, that at
one time there were no less than forty-eight Egyptian
obelisks standing in that city. Of these, only twelve now
remain visible and erect, and most of them have been
removed from other positions they formerly occupied in Rome.
The remainder, excepting two (one taken to France, and the
other to Florence), are, it is supposed, buried in the ruins
of ancient Rome. The twelve now standing vary in height
from a very short one, 8 feet 6 inches high, to the largest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
102 feet high, not reckoning the pedestals, which&mdash;in some
cases inappropriate&mdash;add much to the height, nor the additions,
equally inappropriate, made to some of them upon
the apex. All have been hewn out of the syenite red
granite quarries of Egypt, but three of them, including
that in the Piazza of St. Peter, were extracted by the
Romans themselves from these quarries, and have no hieroglyphics,
the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the remainder
attesting their true Egyptian origin. The obelisk now in
London is 68 feet 5½ inches high, being scarcely the height
of the fourth in size in Rome, which is 69 feet. But the
weight of the London obelisk is only 186 tons, while the
weight of the largest (also the oldest, dating back to 1740
B.C.) obelisk in Rome, that placed before the Church of
St. John Lateran, is 437 tons, or considerably more than
double. The removal to Rome of this last-mentioned huge
and weighty block of stone, and its erection on its pedestal,
was an undertaking of immense labour and cost, taxing
the resources and appealing to the honour of emperors for
its accomplishment. The mere erection upon its present
position of that now standing in the Piazza of St. Peter’s
(the second in size, and weighing 331 tons), in the time of
Sextus <span class="smcap">V.</span>, cost £9000. It was on this memorable occasion,
when under pain of death, certain to be inflicted,
all were commanded to be silent, and the ropes were about
to give way, the Italian sailor from Bordighera, at the peril
of his life, called out, ‘Wet the ropes!’ and saved the
obelisk from destruction. He was himself pardoned, and
obtained for Bordighera as reward the privilege of supplying
Rome with palm leaves at Easter.</p>

<p class="p2">Outside the walls of Rome, particularly on entering or
leaving by railway, long lines of lofty arches are seen, more
or less ruinous (having suffered dilapidation at the hand
of enemies), which supported aqueducts by which ancient
Rome was supplied with water. At one time there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
no less than twenty-four of these aqueducts, entering Rome
from various distances. The water was brought along on
the gravitation principle, the inclination being believed to
have been 1 foot in 400; for although it seems the Romans
were acquainted with the scientific fact of which we now
avail ourselves, that water in a closed pipe will find its
own level, they did not to any extent act upon their
knowledge of it. The water so brought in was distributed
to an immense number of small reservoirs, or wells or
fountains, for the use of the inhabitants, the surplus water
being scrupulously employed to flush and scour the sewers.
But it was also used to supply the baths of Rome. The
bath was regarded by the old Romans as a necessary of
life; and many luxurious men, who had not the newspaper
or the last new book to wile away the time, bathed as often
as seven or eight times a day&mdash;great and small, men and
women, all mingling promiscuously in the water. To provide
for this voluptuous habit, the baths were numerous,
and constructed on an enormous scale. There were no less
than sixteen establishments throughout Rome, intended not
merely for the purposes of ablution, but to supply other
means of recreation, and public places where the citizens
might meet each other. The Thermæ of Agrippa, of Caracalla,
of Constantine, of Diocletian, and of Titus, still exist
in ruins, some of them exemplifying their magnitude.
Those of Diocletian, close by the railway station, were the
most extensive, measuring more than a mile in circumference.
Our time permitted of a visit to only one of these
Thermæ, the Thermæ of Caracalla, which, enormous in extent
as they were, were only half as large as those of Diocletian.
They lie about three-quarters of a mile from the Arch of
Constantine, and usually, in a drive to the Catacombs of St.
Calixtus, are taken going or returning. The extent of the
rooms is something marvellous. The building itself was an
oblong enclosed by walls, and is stated to be above 700 feet
in length, by nearly 400 feet wide, or nearly half a mile in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
circuit.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Little remains of the structure excepting huge
walls or carcases of brick, at one time covered with plates
or blocks of marble, which have been removed, and either
used in churches or other buildings, or, in accordance with
a very vexatious custom, burnt for lime. The rooms, as
indicated by the ruins left, must have been of great
magnificence, not merely from their size and their marble
pillars, coating, and flooring, but from the mosaics with
which they were inlaid, and the splendid statues with
which they were adorned. Some of the statues have been
dug out of the ruins, and among them the famous large
group called the Farnese Bull, which we saw in the museum
of Naples, with many others now deposited in the museums
of that city and of Rome. To accommodate the bathers,
there were placed around the baths polished marble chairs
(cool seats for the undressed), in those of Caracalla to the
number of 1600, in those of Diocletian to the number of
3200. The scene during the bathing hours was no doubt
very animated, for the baths were crowded.</p>

<p>I may here state that the supply of water to modern
Rome is both abundant and of good quality, a circumstance
of great importance, and not always to be reckoned upon
in other Italian cities, where the water is looked upon,
perhaps justly, with great suspicion.</p>

<p class="p2">The Catacombs of Rome are very numerous and of great
extent, and it has been calculated that if all the passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
were placed in continuous line, they would extend to 545
miles. Those of Calixtus are what are most commonly
visited.</p>

<p>The drive to the Catacombs of Calixtus is very interesting;
the ground lies by the Appian Way some distance out
of the city, and beyond the Porta St. Sebastian. On the
way the tombs of the Cæsars and Scipios are passed, and
in a neighbouring private garden (on entering which it is
highly proper to settle the fee to be paid) there are two
buildings sunk in the ground, termed Columbaria&mdash;pigeon-holes&mdash;apartments
probably about 20 feet square, judging
from recollection. Descending by a narrow stair, the walls
are found covered over with small plates of marble, and
under each plate a little niche is formed, containing a vase.
The marble plates bear the names of persons deceased, and
in the vases below their ashes were deposited. They are
curious, carrying one back to ancient times, and becoming,
too, a sort of preparative for the visit to the Catacombs, to
see which a <i>permesso</i> is requisite, a fee being, however,
paid at exit to the conductor for each person, varying a
little in amount according to the number. As soon as
a sufficient party is collected, and waiting until the party
which may be below has reappeared, for only one set is
taken at a time, the man in charge of the Catacombs
makes up the company for the visit. Each person then
lights the taper with which he or she ought to be provided
(which, as tapers are not supplied at the place, must
be brought from the city, a circumstance sometimes overlooked),
and descent is made by a stair. The visitors are
rapidly marched or whisked along the narrow intricate
passages, on each side of which they see the catacombs
in which the bodies of persons deceased were formerly
laid&mdash;the great burial-place of the first Christians. There
are many old Latin inscriptions, which the guide stops a
minute to point out; but with a very large number it is
difficult for all to get near him. It does not appear as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
if the passages lay far below ground, I should imagine
not exceeding 50 feet; but though the air is warm, it is a
dismal place, which the generality of people, seeing once,
will not care to see again. One requires to be careful
to follow the guide to avoid being lost. The examination
does not occupy so much as half an hour.</p>

<p class="p2">On returning to the light of day we were glad to take a
drive farther along the Appian Way. This famous old
Roman road was constructed at enormous cost, and was
26 feet wide. At one part a mountain was cut down
120 feet, to obtain that levelness which the Romans
always desired for their roads. In its original state it must
have offered a very remarkable scene. For, though not
unusual for the Romans to bury, or at least to erect monuments
to the dead, along the side of public roads, the Appian
Way was the favourite part for entombment. For many
miles on each side it was lined by sculptured monuments or
tombs in marble, of more or less size or magnificence. But
all that is now left is, in general, nothing but portions of the
brick carcases which underlay the stone or marble surface.
Vast numbers of these monuments have been destroyed for
the sake of the material. The only notable monument remaining
to some extent in preservation is the large and
massive tomb of Cecilia Metella&mdash;a circular tower 70 feet
in diameter, the walls of which are 25 feet thick. Its
strength caused it at one time to be used as a fortress. The
Appian Way itself fell into ruin and became impassable, but
has now been cleared; and one can look along it and see
it proceeding as far as the eye can reach in a straight line.
It terminates at Puteoli, which when we were at Naples
we visited, and so had the good fortune, if it may be so
called, to pass over both ends of the road, immortalized by
the Scripture record as that by which the Apostle Paul
went on his way to Rome.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomson, in an interesting paper on the <i>Recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Excavations in Rome</i>, in which he gives, by illustrative
restorations as proposed by Canina of monuments in
portions of the Way, some idea of its grandeur, says (p. 28):</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">‘Altogether the Via Appia, when in its pristine glory, must have been a
wondrous scene, with its innumerable monuments extending on both sides
of fifteen miles of roadway, varied by occasional villas of great extent and
beauty, by temples, by exedræ or covered seats, and by fountains. These
are of every age and style, from the simplest republican to the richest
adornments of imperial times.</p>

<p>‘The Via Appia was the road by which travellers from Spain, or Africa, or
the East, arrived at the city.</p>

<p>‘How striking this approach to the Mistress of the World! How heart-stirring
the memories of the illustrious departed which it must have called
up in every heart!</p>

<p>‘We are not aware of any similar arrangement of equal extent and grandeur
among all the remains of ancient times.’</p></div>

<p class="p1">So numerous are the churches in Rome, that I believe it
may be said there is one for every day in the year. They
abound everywhere, and during a short visit one can only,
of course, see a few of those which may be regarded as
among the chief. All of them, however, possess some distinguishing
mark to attract attention. We entered a good
many, the very names of which we did not know. And it is
useful to notice that in general it is necessary to visit the
churches before twelve o’clock; after the hour of noon
they are closed, except in the case of some of the more
important.</p>

<p>The Pantheon (built <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 27) is the only ancient building
in Rome which is now standing entire, although bereft of
its ornamentation; but such has been the accumulation of
rubbish around it, that the steps leading up to it are now
considerably below the level of the street. The edifice
itself, also, is much hid by surrounding houses, and is not
seen till one is close upon it. Passing through a grand
columnar portico, we enter a vast circular expanse 140 feet
wide, surmounted by a dome 140 feet high. There are
large recesses or deep niches around, which were formerly
used as receptacles for statues of the gods, when it became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a Roman temple. The place now looks very vacant. The
building has been stripped also externally of its marble
covering or skin and other adornments, so that it no longer
exhibits the magnificence it once possessed. But here
Raphael and other great painters have been buried, and
here the body of Victor Emmanuel, the gallant first King of
Italy, has found its resting-place. Mr. Thomson observes:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘The noblest of all the remains of ancient Rome, the Pantheon was, without
doubt, originally built as a portion of these (Agrippa’s) baths; it is
proved by the contiguity of the other fragments, and by the identity of the
style of the brickwork. It was turned into a temple by Agrippa himself, on
which occasion he added the portico of sixteen Corinthian columns of granite,
each of one stone, 50 feet 9 inches in length and 5 feet 9 inches in diameter.
Thirteen of these remain as originally placed; the three on the east side are
modern restorations.’<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="p1">San Pietro in Vinculi is visited because it possesses
Michael Angelo’s grand colossal statue of Moses. Notwithstanding
its masterly power, it is far from pleasing in
the confined space in which it is placed.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Church (under which one of the lost
obelisks has been unfortunately buried) is very gorgeously
adorned, and the altar of St. Ignatius (the body of Ignatius
Loyola lies below it) exhibits a globe of lapis lazuli,
said to be the largest known. This, like every other
church at Rome, is besieged by beggars at the door,
who whiningly importune for coppers, and one of them
always officiously pushes open the thick, heavy, greasy
mat placed swinging at the doorway, to keep out the cold
air and to offer a convenient asylum to the insect world,
and thus, as it is never cleaned, affording a valid excuse for
a demand (were reason required). But in all the churches
where anything is to be seen inside, a spider is on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
watch in the shape of a guardian, who, keys in hand,
proffers his services to open locked doors and exhibit the
treasures of the church, or to draw curtains which conceal
principal paintings. However, the fee is small; one
franc or half a franc for the party generally suffices.</p>

<p>One of these churches, containing a veiled picture, the
celebrated St. Michael of Guido Reni, is that of the Capuccini.
The picture is certainly well worth seeing, and, in some
respects, it may claim a preference over that of the same
subject by Raphael in the Louvre. But why should such
pictures&mdash;except for fees&mdash;be veiled? The veiling is very
detrimental to the colour, as the exclusion of sunlight will
in time make a picture black. Italian churches are dark
enough as built, without shutting out the light of day from
the paintings by an impervious curtain.</p>

<p>That for which, however, people chiefly go to the Capuccini
is the extraordinary vaulting below the church. Here are
arranged in all manner of devices the bones of the monks
attached to the Capuccini monastery, of which this is the
church. The skeletons of the more noted are exposed entire in
their garments, some of them 300 years old. It is a ghastly
spectacle, and was shown to us by a monk, who told us he
expected his own bones, when he died, would be placed in the
vaults, although we had understood the practice had been
stopped.</p>

<p>Of a very different kind of interest was what is underground
of two other churches,&mdash;San Clementi and San
Cosmo in Damian. In the vaults below them we were
shown the remains of the original churches, built not later
than the fourth century, though the precise date cannot be
ascertained. Those of San Clementi, discovered in excavating
since 1858, are extensive and extremely interesting,
including frescoes of the eighth and ninth centuries&mdash;one
of them being the Crucifixion. It carries one back to
Christianity in Rome of a very early period.</p>

<p>No visitor to Rome fails to visit San Giovanni in Laterano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
This is a spacious edifice with altars all round, and is one of
the grand churches in Rome, dating back a long way, and
historically celebrated. It is, of course, splendidly adorned.
The baptistery, like that at Pisa, is an entirely separate
building in the Piazza. The Lateran Museum adjoins the
church, and on the ground floor contains a collection of
ancient statues, the entrance to which we had some difficulty
in finding. The upper floor is chiefly remarkable for its
collection of inscriptions inserted in the walls, taken from
the Catacombs, and of which there is an immense number;
but there was nobody to give any information. The famous
Santa Scala, said to be the steps of the staircase of Pontius
Pilate’s house, up which, it is given out, our Lord walked,
is on the opposite side of the Piazza. The steps are covered
with wood to prevent them being further worn. We saw
a good many of the faithful painfully and laboriously
ascending it upon their knees,&mdash;a very tedious operation,
and sometimes, it is said, from its difficulty and unwonted
novelty, a ludicrous one, the people (who are of all classes,
and fine ladies as well as common men) in their contortions
nearly tumbling over or knocking each other about. At
every few steps there is a fixed cross to kiss, and at each
step fresh paternosters are said; and when at last they attain
the top (the stair consists, according to my reckoning, of
twenty-eight steps), they kneel upon a small bench and look
through an opening into a sacred chapel beyond, and perform
further devotions. We heretics ascended more rapidly by
one of the two side stairs by which the devotees descend.</p>

<p>A more splendid church than that of the Lateran is the
Santa Maria Maggiore, so named from being the largest of
eighty churches in Rome dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It
is also one of the oldest churches in existence, and has a
handsome façade, in front of which a lofty Corinthian
column stands, surmounted by a statue of Philip <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of
Spain. The interior is profusely decorated, and is remarkably
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>But perhaps the church which of all others, after St.
Peter’s, attracts most attention, is that of ‘San Paolo fuori le
mura.’ This is situated about a mile and a half outside
the Porta San Paolo, in a road where foot passengers had
been lately robbed, and was not, therefore, considered to be
very safe for them. But no apprehension was felt in proceeding
by carriage, and it forms a pleasant drive from the
city. In going, the English cemetery, and the Pyramid of
Cestus adjoining, both outside the walls, are passed. These
we had intended visiting, but by a mistake of our driver we
were taken some way beyond the entrance gate, and then
unluckily postponed our visit for another opportunity, which
never came, and our return to the city on the occasion was
by a different route. The Church of St. Paul, erected on
the road to Tre Fontane, where it is said the apostle was
beheaded, is a new one, the former one having been destroyed
by fire in 1823. The original church was founded so far
back as the fourth century, and became in time one of great
magnificence. Externally there is nothing remarkable about
the present building, but internally it is one mass of marble
ornament on a grand scale. It was expected, when commenced,
the cost would amount to £1,500,000; but it
is alleged that as much as £10,000,000 sterling have
already been spent upon it. This may be quite the case.
£10,000,000 according to some, and £20,000,000 according
to others, have in three centuries been expended on St.
Peter’s, and that during times when money was more valuable.
But whatever has been the cost, it must necessarily have been
enormous. The church consists of immense, square-shaped
rooms,&mdash;huge boxes,&mdash;which are not over-pleasing architecturally.
Floors and walls are covered with large plates of
marble of every description, and long rows of costly granite
pillars (80 in number) and of oriental alabaster pillars imposingly
line the aisles. Four of the oriental yellow alabaster
columns are supported on malachite pedestals presented by
the Emperor of Russia. The ceilings (flat) are decorated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and along the walls under them a very long series of portraits
of all the popes has been executed in mosaic. The
windows are filled with stained glass containing representations
of sacred events. The decorations of the church,
which comprise some saved from the fire, are not yet completed,
and at present (that is, when we saw it) a feeling of
emptiness was conveyed; but when, in course of time, it is
filled up with fine statues, paintings, and other ornaments,
like other Roman Catholic churches, as no doubt it will be,
this feeling of vacancy will disappear, and although in design
it may not brook comparison with other churches, it will
probably be the most sumptuous building in the world. Outside
the church there is a beautiful court of cloisters of the
Benedictine monastery; but the site is unhealthy, and the
monastery cannot be inhabited during the summer. If nobody
remains in charge of this costly church during summer,
I do not know how it is guarded from depredation. It
seems a great risk to build it in such a situation. Perhaps
the laws against sacrilege may be so severe as to deter.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>There are many other churches in Rome which should
be visited, but cannot be described in a sketch like the
present. Indeed, the fullest description of such places can
only enable a stranger to realize them very imperfectly.</p>

<p class="p2">The palaces in Rome, or what are termed such, are as
great an attraction as the churches, and to many much
more so. There are about seventy of one kind or another,
generally huge old buildings, some of which are open to
the public on certain days of the week, or on other stated
days,&mdash;a fee of 1 franc per party being given to the
doorkeeper at leaving, which is always the time in Italy
when fees are paid, except when admission is by ticket,
paid for at entrance. Most of these palaces are visited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the collections of paintings and sculptures which they contain,
some of which are very valuable. Generally the second
storey is devoted to these collections, the first being sometimes
occupied as shops or as servants’ apartments, and the
upper floors by the family. Leaving umbrellas and sticks
at the door, visitors pass from one room to another unattended,
although there are men usually going quietly
about to keep watch. There are lists in each room, printed
on cardboard, of the pictures in it,&mdash;one side being generally
in Italian, and the other in French. It would be perfectly
endless to describe these various collections. Those most
worthy of notice are specified in Hare’s <i>Walks in Rome</i>,
which is a useful guide to them. But it would really be
conferring a great boon upon visitors to Rome if some one
were to publish a catalogue of all the collections in the
manner of the <i>Academy Notes</i>, illustrating the noteworthy.
Only by such means is it possible to retain in memory, or
recall distinctly and without confusion, some recollection of
their varied contents, and where given pictures are to be
found.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Photographs of many can no doubt be procured,
and are useful, and, so far as they go, better than the little
rough sketches of the <i>Academy Notes</i>; but the collection of
such photographs is limited (they are for the most part
taken from engravings), and they can only be picked up by
degrees. There is, however, a very valuable collection of
engravings, published under direction of the Italian Government,
of the choicest of the pictures and sculptures; and a
few pounds may be well spent in purchases, which can be
safely carried home rolled in tin cases which are supplied
for the purpose. The shop in which they are sold is close
to the Fountain of Treves, No. 6 Via Stamperia. The
catalogue, extending to 33 pages, is divided into three parts,&mdash;<i>Pittura</i>,
<i>Scultura</i>, and <i>Architettura</i>,&mdash;and in the first part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
comprises the works of 43 painters. The engravings are
fairly moderate in price.</p>

<p class="p2">The galleries for the most part contain specimens of the
great masters,&mdash;such as Titian, Guido Reni, Vandyke, and
almost every other master of note,&mdash;though most frequently
of the Italian masters and artists. Some of these collections
are very extensive. That of the Borghese Palace occupies
no less than twelve rooms. Among so many pictures there
is always to be found a great amount of mediocrity, interspersed
with works and gems of the highest art, over which
one could gladly linger. On most of them age has bestowed
its mellow tint. There is a richness and power in these
old masters which one misses in modern galleries; and after
visiting the principal collections in Italy, and fresh from
the Louvre in Paris, I felt as if landed in a new world on
entering the Royal Academy in London.</p>

<p>In some of the galleries persons are usually to be seen
making copies of more or less merit of noted paintings, the
copying of pictures being apparently, as it is in other Italian
cities, a considerable branch of business in Rome. The
casino of the Rospigliosi is visited principally for the celebrated
Aurora of Guido Reni, with which that of Guercino
cannot compare. It is a large work of art, which, like too
many others, is painted on a ceiling, at all times an awkward
position in which to be seen; and so awkward, too, for the
artist, that to copy it always seems a very wonderful effort of
execution. In this case, however, with much consideration
for visitors’ necks, a mirror is placed on a table below for
the purpose of reflecting it at a convenient angle, and in
this way it can be studied. As the masterpiece of the
great painter (for Guido can hold his place alongside of
Titian and Raphael), this picture is a very favourite subject
of copy; and while we were in the room, there were three
or four artists making copies of it varying in size. I asked
the price of one good-sized copy, the execution of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
was remarkably good, and the answer was, 600 francs&mdash;£24
nominally, or about £21 calculating according to the
then state of the exchange (which, however, does not enter
into the artist’s calculations) with England. There was a
good deal of work upon it, and it might possibly be fairly
worth the money; but, according to the Italian mode of
dealing, more may have been stated than would be taken,
although it is only fair to say that in any transactions I
have myself had with the Italian painters, this does not
seem to be a practice which extends to them.</p>

<p>At the Barberini Palace, the favourite subject of copy is
what is termed the head of Beatrice Cenci, by Guido Reni,
although doubt has been cast upon the statement that it is
the portrait of her who was executed upon being, rightly
or wrongly, condemned as one of the murderers of her father.
Whoever it may represent, the eyes in this lovely pale face,
with a quiet, tender, inexpressible sorrow, fix themselves on
the spectator; but it is a melancholy and suggestively sad
picture, to which the white headgear very much adds.
Why people should desire to have copies of it, it is difficult
to say. Its attraction lies in its inimitable painting, which
none of the copies reproduce. Indeed, some of them are
simply hideous or grotesque. Yet copies, more or less bad,
are seen everywhere; and not merely is the head copied on
canvas, but it is transferred to china, to wood, and other
material on which reproduction is necessarily coarse; as if
the subject in itself were attractive.</p>

<p class="p2">Besides the palaces, there are regular galleries, such as
the Academia di San Luca, a collection of the old masters,
although not very extensive. Visitors also can obtain
admittance to the studios of artists and sculptors, who are
always glad to see them. We did not do much, however,
in this way. We called on Mr. Glennie, an English artist
settled in Rome, to whom we had an introduction, and had
the pleasure of seeing several of his pictures, principally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
water-colour. Mr. Lawrence MacDonald, the venerable-looking
old Scotchman, since deceased, kindly with his son
showed us over their studio, in which were many fine pieces
of sculpture; and Signor Rosetti was also good enough to
let us see his collection, which contained a large number of
finely conceived and executed sculptures in white marble,
at prices much below what is expected at home for similar
works. A small fee (1 franc) is given at leaving to the
workman who attends or opens the door.</p>

<p class="p2">We heard that the Royal Palace (Quirinal) could be seen,
and accordingly visited it. After inscribing our names in
a visitors’ book, we were shown round the rooms by an
attendant. The palace is on the Quirinal Hill, and is one
of several which the King of Italy maintains; some of
which, I doubt not, he would gladly dispense with, as adding
unnecessarily to the cost of his establishment. It formerly
belonged to the Popes, and the room was shown us in which
the cardinals used to sit in conclave for the election of
the Pope, which, when completed, was announced from a
balcony to the people congregated outside. There are several
spacious apartments in the building, adorned by some interesting
paintings and sculptures. We were taken through
the audience and other public <i>salons</i>, including the ballroom,
which is decorated in a peculiar manner, especially
by mirrors, on which appropriate figures have been depicted.
The ceiling is painted to represent dancers in the air, and
the floor is of polished wood. Some of the rooms are
tapestried. A franc to the attendant, and a half-franc to
the porter who had charge of our umbrellas, was all that
was expected.</p>

<p class="p2">The grounds of some of the villas about Rome are also
opened to the public; but they are not kept with the neatness
and tidiness which characterize gentlemen’s grounds
at home. The most important or most extensive is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the Villa Borghese. The gate of entrance to this
great park, laid out in a way which is peculiarly Italian, is
just outside the Porta del Popolo. The grounds are open
daily, except on Mondays, and it is a favourite resort for
all classes in the afternoon. After a long drive through
them we reached the Casino, a building of many rooms, on
two floors, devoted to a very large collection of sculptures,
which well merits several visits. The Roman ladies, like
other Italians, are very fond of driving about in style, with
coachman and footman on the box; and a good part of their
afternoon appears to be spent in these grounds and on the
Pincian Hill, which adjoins, and in the gardens of which a
band of music plays in the afternoons, attracting, as the
only public garden&mdash;and it is of small dimensions&mdash;which the
Romans seem to have, a fashionable crowd. The Pincian
gardens are very prettily laid out, and there are excellent
views of Rome from this height (one of the two highest of
the hills of Rome), especially looking towards St. Peter’s.
A splendid survey of the city is also obtained from the hill on
which San Pietro in Montorio stands, being to the south-west
of St. Peter’s, and therefore facing the Pincian Hill. From
both points, as well as from others in Rome, the eye takes in
the prospect of the Campagna, and of the mountains beyond;
among which nestle several villages by name well known,
such as Albano, Frascati, and Tivoli.</p>

<p class="p2">To see the last mentioned, together with a little of the
Campagna, we devoted a day. For this purpose we hired
a carriage, the charge for which was 35 francs. Bædeker
says it is 25 francs; one of those instances which show
that implicit reliance cannot always be placed on guidebook
figures, although it is quite possible that a person
resident in Rome, and acquainted with the ways and language,
might bargain for the lesser sum.</p>

<p>There had been some wet weather, and the morning on
which we were to start was overcast; but our coachman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
was confident that the day would be fine, as indeed it
proved, and we left at half-past seven&mdash;a necessarily early
hour, so as both to afford time for the trip and to obtain
the cool of the day for the drive. Although the excursion
was very enjoyable, a great part of the road lay through
the flat, uninteresting Campagna, relieved by here and there
a few houses, by an old robber’s castle, and by other ruins.
It is melancholy to observe these extensive plains now so
unhealthy, formerly so salubrious and fertile; now apparently
all but uninhabited, but in the days of Rome’s glory so full
of life. Hardly a tree is to be seen, and one could wish
very much that there was an extensive planting of the
Eucalyptus tree, which, if it would thrive, might probably
contribute to the restoration of the land to a healthy condition,
or to some extent neutralize the malaria, believed to
arise from the destruction of the villas and gardens and
groves with which it was formerly covered, and from the
festering of the ruins below ground. It is said that the
natives, who probably get to a certain extent inured to
residence in a locality so unhealthy, object to plantation;
and perhaps the climate might in winter be too severe for
a tree which is easily blighted by the frost. Other and
hardier trees may, however, be equally well adapted for the
purpose, and as the whole subject has been and is under
consideration of the authorities, perhaps we may soon hope
to see better things. Indeed, I should imagine that the
Campagna has already been improved by drainage or otherwise;
at all events, if haze be a symptom of the unhealthiness,
we did not observe much haze hanging over the fields.
The way was enlivened by occasionally passing regiments
of Italian soldiers, here as elsewhere engaged closely at
drill, no doubt in preparation for the possibility of being
called upon to engage on one side or the other (for the
side was a matter uncertain) in the war which had then
recently been commenced, or at least declared, between
Russia and Turkey, and into which there seemed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
lamentable possibility of the other European nations being
drawn. These little Italian soldiers were clad as usual in
that compound of warm and light clothing which is suitable
for a climate where one part of the day is cold and another
hot. In fact, it is very curious, in a country with which one
associates so much of sun and heat, to see how universally
the Italian men, at all events in spring-time, go about with
heavy thick cloth greatcoats or cloaks, sometimes half on,
dangling from the shoulder, but ready to be wrapped about
them when the cold descends. We also occasionally passed
one of those picturesquely-dressed mounted shepherds which
are seen in pictures; more frequently we overtook some of
the country carts, drawn by the strong and patient buffaloes,
so common in Italy, but which strike a native of Britain as
singularly primitive.</p>

<p>About half-way to Tivoli, which is sixteen miles from
Rome, we approached the Lago di Tartari and a sulphurous
stream which issues from it and flows under the road, scenting
the air for some distance around. As we drew near to
the mountains, which are all along in sight, the country improved;
and diverging by a road to the right, we arrived at
Hadrian’s Villa, the admission to which is by ticket, 1 franc
each. This is the ruin of an extraordinary country residence,
built by the Emperor Hadrian on a most magnificent and
extensive scale. It contained a theatre, a hippodrome, baths,
temples, and every description of edifice in use in the time
of the Romans, and that on a grand plan, and adorned with
marble and sculptures, some of which have been recovered
from the ruins&mdash;a walk among which gives, though imperfectly,
a wonderful idea of the extraordinary splendour and
opulence of the Roman emperors.</p>

<p>Returning to the main road, and slowly proceeding up a
long, steep ascent, the town or village of Tivoli was reached.
It stands high, and the ruins of two temples are situated
close upon the famous waterfalls. Visitors here stop at the
little Sibylla Hotel, usually bringing their lunch with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
as we did, and a table is spread under the temple of the
Sibyl, on a platform which commands views towards the
falls and mountains. For the accommodation so afforded
we were charged 4 francs, and we enjoyed their Frascati
wine. When we rose to make the usual round, we were
besieged by loitering guides and idle people offering to take
us to the falls. Having hired a donkey for my wife, I told
the rest we had no need for them. But they would take
no refusal; and although informed decidedly they were not
wanted, two men with a chaise <i>à porteur</i> persistently followed
us all the way down, asking to be engaged, and
diminishing their demands as we descended and the prospect
of employment became more and more hopeless. We were
also annoyed by all sorts of begging and methods of asking
money; one respectable-looking woman, who had a child
suspended in a peculiar sort of go-cart, which, as a curiosity,
we were looking at, was not ashamed to ask for some <i>soldi</i>
in respect of the ‘bambino;’ in fact, nobody there, or
elsewhere in Italy, seems ashamed to beg.</p>

<p>The falls were not so grand as we had expected to find
them, although there is one thundering cascade. We had
intended going to see the Villa d’Este, but a lady who had
been there before dissuaded us, as not worth seeing, though
I understand the grounds are; and as it would have taken
time, and we were anxious to be home early, for it is not
good to be out in the Campagna after dusk, we left in the
afternoon in spite of the protestations of the coachman, who
for some unknown reason would have detained us two
hours longer, and got back to Rome about half-past six, in
time for dinner, and sufficiently late at that season to be
out. Outside the walls we stopped at the Church of San
Lorenzo fuori le mura, and entered it. Its old pillars,
pavement, and mosaics, its pulpit and its peculiar construction,
make it remarkable, and well worthy of a visit. On
returning to the carriage, one of the ladies missed a cloak,
which in all likelihood had been adroitly abstracted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
loitering beggar, of whom there were several at the gate of
the church.</p>

<p class="p2">In any mention of a visit to Rome, one can scarcely
omit some notice of the Roman shops. I suppose that no
visitor to Rome leaves without making purchases of one
description or another, or of all. Apparently, the Americans
go in more largely than others for purchases of all kinds,
and one reason for that may possibly be the fear their
visit to Italy may never be repeated. One lady, in the
house in which we were, had bought so many things of
divers sorts that she required to get seven boxes made to
hold them. They comprised marble busts, copies of paintings,
bronzes, photographs, and I know not what besides.
All these can be bought at prices not only greatly less than
in America, where everything is dear, but also much less
than in Great Britain, if indeed they can be had out of
Italy; but to the price the purchaser requires in his calculations
to add the cost of carriage and import duty (where
exigible), and to take into view the risk of transit.</p>

<p>There are many photograph shops in Rome, and at most
of them one can purchase cheaply all descriptions. They
are often filled with people selecting examples, chiefly of
buildings and pictures. It is needful to know where to go,
but this is soon learned, either by experience or by recommendation
of fellow photograph-hunters. I have seen the
same photographs, and equally good, sold at one shop at half
the price they were sold at another. The cheaper shops
are therefore crowded, while the others (in which, however,
some large and good photographs claiming to be high-class
are sold) enjoy their <i>otium cum dignitate</i>. Some of the
photographs exhibited in the windows&mdash;as, for example, of
St. Peter’s and the Colosseum&mdash;are of great size, requiring
to be printed on two or three large sheets.</p>

<p>Another description of shop, the most numerous of all,
is that for the sale of Roman, mosaic, and other species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
jewellery. The windows of these jewellers’ shops are filled
with very elegant specimens of mosaic work, in the form of
brooches, bracelets, ear-drops, shawl-pins, etc., composed of
minute coloured stones put together in all sorts of devices,
sometimes in miniature copies of well-known pictures. The
execution is marvellous.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The prices are moderate, but
one requires to keep in mind, in some cases, the Italian
method of demanding a larger price than will be taken.
Even in shops professedly dealing on the principle of
fixed prices, the shopkeepers are not insusceptible of a
diminution, at least upon goods of a high price, although
an offer of a lower price should be made only when it
seems likely to be accepted. The Italians’ idea of selling
in general apparently is, that if they can make a profit,
however small, rather to sell than lose the chance. The
system of asking a long price, to be met with an equally
low offer, and by gradual approximations to come to terms,
is a mode of transacting extremely repugnant to British
habits, but it is sometimes encountered. I have heard of
the same article being offered to an English person at one
price, and sold to a native at little more than half. At the
same time, it is only right to say that this was not in
Rome, where, I think, on the whole, prices seem to be
fair and fixed.</p>

<p>Ladies find in the pretty silk Roman sashes and ribbons,
woven, I believe, by girls on antiquated small looms in the
shops where they are sold, another species of attraction.</p>

<p>Other shops, again, are devoted to the sale of bronze and
marble copies, on a small scale, of statues, heads, and ruins,
particularly columns in the Forum and elsewhere; and
some have small alabaster or Roman marble copies of
sculptures, though for such articles Florence is the greater
mart. Other shops sell copies of celebrated paintings.
The visitor, therefore, has very little difficulty, if possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of time, inclination, and money, in making a good collection
to take home of objects of <i>virtu</i>, or, at least, of what will give
a pleasing recollection of what one has seen in Old Rome.</p>

<p class="p2">But what one sees in Rome can only give the faintest
idea of what it was when mistress of the world. In place
of being confined to the comparatively circumscribed limits
of the walls, a space which at present it only partially
covers, the city, besides being composed of high, many-storied
houses, like those in the Old Town of Edinburgh,
extended for miles over the Campagna, and that perhaps
very densely. Instead of a population now of scarcely
a quarter of a million, the population then is thought to
have greatly exceeded that of London at the present day.
Indeed, some have not hesitated to state it at as high a
figure as 14,000,000, while others, more moderate in their
calculations, have placed it at from 4,000,000 to 6,000,000.
But whatever it may have been (for this is a <i>questio vexata</i>),
it was many times what it has now become. Then consider
the magnificent multiplicity of its buildings and decorations.
For, besides 700 temples<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and other structures of whose
number no record perhaps exists, there were in ancient
Rome at one time, 31 theatres, 11 amphitheatres (and
we have seen the scale upon which these erections were
constructed), 48 obelisks, 66 ivory statues, 82 equestrian
statues, 3785 bronze statues, 1352 fountains, 2091 prisons,
9025 baths, 17,097 palaces. Then keep in view that this
was all during a period when classic taste prevailed, and
everything, as the remains now left testify, was in the
utmost perfection of art, and sometimes of the most
wonderful magnificence. Keep also in view that thousands
of Roman citizens were then of immense opulence, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
evidence of which was that they were possessed of crowds
of slaves, some of them having as many as 10,000 or even
20,000; and think what pomp and style must have been kept
up in the 17,000 palaces of Rome, surging out upon its
360 spacious streets and its countless minor <i>vias</i>, and one
approaches to an idea of the superb grandeur of the great
city; in the presence of which it does make us feel small to
think, that while we lavish millions on war, we cannot so
much as, at the hundredth part of the cost of one of our little
wars, build and complete a single temple in the perfection
of the ancients, seeing we have the National Monument on
the Calton Hill, so bravely begun, in a condition calculated
merely to expose the indifference to high art with which
the British nation is afflicted. But we cannot be sorry for
the fall of Rome, and only should take warning from it,
because its power was built up on military force, and its
riches were got, not by the successful prosecution of
peaceful pursuits, but by the conquest and plunder and
the subjection of other nations.</p>

<p>Nor can we any more deplore that modern Rome is
now shorn of the prestige it enjoyed while the Popes were
once all-potent. Strangers can no longer be gratified by
the sight of priestly pageants and papal shows. But let
us be thankful that, as the Pope hides his head, the civil
power has risen; and now, in place of persecution, torture,
and death for those who would not bow the knee to a
corrupted religion, the Inquisition&mdash;that cruel, hateful
instrument of religious intolerance and priestly tyranny&mdash;is
at an end, and every one can worship God within the walls
of Rome as his conscience dictates, none daring to make
him afraid. The only strange reflection<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> which arises is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
that while so many in England, where education prevails
and people should know better, are allowing themselves to
be drawn back again into the trammels of Rome, the
people of Rome and of Italy, with all their ignorance, are
shaking off a yoke which neither they nor their fathers
were able to bear, and rejoicing to be free.</p>

<p class="p2">We had been nine days in Rome, and before seeing it
further, thought it advisable to take a run to Naples, and
rest in that locality, for so much sight-seeing was fatiguing.
During even this short time we had done a great deal, and
the break of going away operated, as it were, as a first
visit, preliminary to a further investigation upon our
second visit of what then became to us in a manner as
familiar old friends. Even in both our visits, made out of
the common motive of curiosity, and with no higher aims,
we could only consider we had examined things in a most
superficial way, leaving besides a great deal that was
unexplored. It is often said that even a whole winter in
Rome is inadequate to do justice to its sights. In a single
forenoon we have been to as many as a dozen different places.
We entered Rome with the idea that it would be the first
and only visit of a lifetime. We left it with the feeling
that we had only seen enough to make it more easy for us
to comprehend the subject at home, so that some years later
we might all return to investigate it together in greater
detail, or with more perfect acquaintance with what we had
to see, to know, and to think about. Alas! how little did
we then anticipate that that future day, to one of us at least,
whose hopes were bright and whose enjoyment of all was
deep and thorough, would never come!</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>NAPLES, POMPEII, SORRENTO.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">It</span> proved a very wet morning in Rome on the day we had
settled to go to Naples (for it can rain in Rome remarkably
well); but we had taken our rooms at a hotel in Naples,
and were packed and ready to go, and accordingly left,
arriving at the station at half-past eight for the train
leaving at 9.20, and were not a bit too soon. The
traveller has to hang on for his turn to get his luggage
weighed and to purchase his railway tickets; and after these
operations were accomplished, and admission was at last
accorded to the <i>salle-d’attente</i> (for none, according to the
evil custom which keeps ladies hanging about on their
feet, can enter previously), we had but a few minutes to
wait in that apartment until the doors were opened and
announcement made that passengers might now hurry to
the train.</p>

<p class="p2">For a considerable part of the way the rain fell and heavy
clouds hung upon the mountains, so that little could be
seen of the scenery in the early part of the journey, which
is the most interesting, as the line commands in many
parts historical ground. We passed the Alban and Volscian
Mountains; the town of Capua, where are interesting
Roman remains; Caserta, where there is an immense royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
palace; and many curious old towns resting upon the hills
which the railway skirted. It would have been well worth
while to have stayed at Capua and Caserta to have seen
them, but it is difficult to arrange for doing so without
spending a night by the way, or continuing the journey by
a night train, because trains do not suit. This being the
26th of March, vegetation was in a very backward state,
the trees just beginning to show symptoms of being about
to throw out their buds, so that everything looked somewhat
dreary. At last we arrived in Naples, after a seven
hours’ ride, just in time to settle down before dinner.</p>

<p class="p2">The following morning we took a cab to drive through
and see the town, and, looking to select a good one, I was
beset by a host of cabmen, all wanting to be engaged, even
after I had engaged one, and told them so positively.
There is very little choice among them. The vehicles are all
equally shabby, and the drivers all equally dirty. Their
fares are very low, which may account for the disreputable
appearance of the men and cabs, which are as numerous as
bees in a hive. The coachmen will take any amount of
trouble to get a hire. If, upon going to a place, say the
Museum, they be dismissed, they will hang about for an
hour, hoping to get the return fare. But driving is really
the only way by which one can see some parts of Naples.
The town swarms with people to an extent which, unless
seen, can hardly be either realized or credited. In England,
every rod may maintain its man, but in Naples, and even
all about the Bay of Naples, it would seem as if not merely
every square yard, but almost every square foot maintained
its man, woman, or child. But how they all live, or even
where they all sleep, is a mystery. The main street, the
Toledo, a mile long, is so crowded, that one wonders how
the carriages can possibly penetrate; and the people are
such notorious thieves and such adroit pickpockets, that it
is dangerous to attempt to walk on foot. Even in driving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the passenger must be very careful, as a thief will think
nothing of abstracting loose articles, even in his very sight.
At the railway station the traveller should keep a sharp
look-out that the very porter who is taking his portmanteau
to a carriage does not quietly run off with it. Knowing
these habits, we left the most of our luggage at Rome,
and only took with us what was indispensable, as every
additional package is in such a case an additional anxiety.</p>

<p class="p2">The Bay of Naples is naturally the first point of attraction.
One hears so much of its transcendent beauty that
expectation is highly raised. I thought the accounts of it
exaggerated; but then it was not summer, and therefore we
could not see it in perfection; while we had just recently come
from Mentone, where we had been living for months in
sight of lovely bays. The blue waters of the Mediterranean
in brilliant sunshine are always charming, and here they
are enclosed in a very large bay&mdash;for it is about twenty
miles each way&mdash;with one long arm stretching away and
terminated by the island of Ischia, and the other long arm
stretching away and terminated by the island of Capri;
the outlines of all being picturesque, and all sides being
dotted with villages. In the centre of the landward side
Vesuvius boldly rises (the eruptions from time to time
causing variations in its height, which, however, averages
about 4000 feet), with a stream of smoke, betokening
its character, constantly ascending from the summit as if
from some colossal chimney; while below, a line of houses
stretches continuously from Naples, probably fifteen miles,
or perhaps even more, indicating how populous is this part
of Italy. In the distance, behind Naples and Vesuvius, a
range of the Apennines lies.</p>

<p class="p2">Naples itself, the largest and most populous city in Italy,
is, from a little distance, picturesque, resting, somewhat
like Genoa, on a half-circle of sloping heights, with a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
margin to the shore, the houses towards which are lofty,
many being five and even six storeys high. In the
central and denser parts of the town they are even higher,
while in these portions the streets are mere lanes, 15 to 20
feet wide, and irregular; and if they be not absolutely
unsafe to visit, must form a very labyrinth of perplexity
to the stranger. In the newer parts of the city
the streets are spacious and elegant. Every here and there,
a jutting prominence or a bold height crowned with some
peculiar structure gives character to the scene. The Chiaja
is a long strip of land turned into a public garden or park
lying in or towards the north end of the town, and fronting
the sea. A broad street, the Riviera di Chiaja, flanks it,
lined by the trees of the park on the one side, and by
hotels and other buildings on the other, and terminated at
the north end by Posilipo, a hill perforated by the famous
grotto of that name, or tunnel, I presume half natural and
half excavated, which affords an access to the other side.
Up from the Chiaja, on a height, the Castle of St. Elmo
stands, the interior of which our limited time did not afford
us opportunity of seeing. Leaving the Chiaja by a handsome
drive which has been formed by the shore, we pass
the Castel del Ovo, which stands out into the sea, cresting
a large rock or small island connected with the land by a
mole or breakwater. It is ugly and old, but can scarcely,
because it is so, be called picturesque, though at least it is
striking or prominent; and I suppose it does or can, with
other fortifications, offer some protection to the port; but it
was, and perhaps still is, used as a prison, and, in spite of
sunshine, is gloomy enough for that. From this point
southward, commencing with the broad Strada San Lucia,
the harbour lies, in which there is a moderate amount of
shipping, but small as compared with that of Genoa. Life
abounds about this harbour and the adjoining quays, along
which broad streets run, filled with sellers of fish and other
commodities, and with crowds of pedestrians and carriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The road turns up from S. Lucia into the large open
space called the Piazza del Plebiscito&mdash;one side occupied by
a handsome semicircular colonnade, and the other by the
royal palace, where the king was at the time of our visit
residing, two equestrian statues in the centre of the piazza
contributing to its adornment. The Toledo or High Street
of Naples issues out of it. Proceeding farther along the
harbour, and at its extreme south, we come to the Castel
del Carmine, also forming a feature in the landscape, and
from it a road leads up to the railway station, which is just
outside the inhabited part of Naples. From the harbour,
or any point which commands a view, the town looks bright
and picturesque, and in rather striking contrast with its
dirty population. Ascent of the lighthouse for the sake of
the view is recommended.</p>

<p class="p2">The only church in Naples which we thought at all
comparable to those in Rome was the cathedral, which is a
large and handsome building. One of its side chapels is
that of the famous St. Januarius, where the blood and other
relics of the martyr are preserved.</p>

<p>The hotels are situated principally on the line of buildings
facing the sea from the Chiaja southward to S. Lucia. But
some new hotels have been opened on the high ground near
the Castle of St. Elmo, thought to be a more healthy locality.
This may or may not be, but one requires to be careful as to
where he lives in Naples. In fact, the natural air of Naples
must be extremely salubrious, to counteract, as it seems to
a large extent to do, the evil influences arising from so large
a population living upon so comparatively small a portion of
the tideless Mediterranean. Were it otherwise, fever would
be constantly raging, and Naples depopulated.</p>

<p class="p2">We spent the forenoon of the following day in the
Museum. This is an immense collection of antiquities,
principally from Pompeii, and is well worthy of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
visits, without which, in fact, it cannot be properly studied.
Illustrated catalogues can be procured, which are no doubt
useful, but are expensive. Our time would only allow of
a general examination. The Museum contains thousands
of articles of great interest, and very many which show to
what a state of perfection art had arrived at the time
Pompeii was destroyed. The sculptures of all descriptions
and pictures are very numerous, and among many others
deserving of special note was the grand group called the
Toro Farnese, of masterly power. It is composed of five
graceful and pleasing human figures, besides the bull
rampant and a dog, and other sculpture, and if cut out of
one block of marble, would seem to be a miracle of art.
Why it should have been removed from Rome to Naples
I am not aware. But the Museum at Naples is very
spacious and extensive, and may have afforded better
accommodation than any place in Rome. Some of the
rooms are filled with articles of domestic use recovered
from the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii; and, what is
very curious, in one room loaves of bread, grain of various
sorts, dates, and other edibles 1800 years old are exhibited.
Many of the curious frescoes found upon the
walls of Pompeii have been removed to the Museum and
built bodily into its walls. The colours of these frescoes
are considerably faded, but copying them seems to afford
employment to a number of artists, who, however, impart
to their copies the supposed original brightness of the
pictures, and one seldom sees an original Pompeian fresco
possessing that vividness of colouring which representations
of them usually manifest. One room is fitted up as a
reproduction of a Pompeian bedroom, and gives a greater
idea of luxurious comfort than one would imagine possible
from the appearance of the rooms, now in ruins, which we
afterwards saw in Pompeii itself.</p>

<p class="p2">The afternoon is the time for seeing the Chiaja, for then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
all the private carriages of Naples may be witnessed
driving about; and on one occasion we had the good
fortune to pass the Princess Margherita, now the Queen of
Italy. Girls are on the watch to sell large and beautiful
bouquets of flowers at marvellously cheap prices. An
aquarium has been built near the centre of the Chiaja
gardens, which we visited the morning of the day following,
before going to Castellamare. It is not nearly so large
as that at Brighton, but it is interesting enough. It contained,
<i>inter alia</i>, a good many octopi, which repulsive fish
is said to be sold and eaten in Naples, and, in all probability,
occasionally appears under some disguised name at
the hotel dinners.</p>

<p class="p2">Naples is a great place for the sale of photographs and
articles of bijouterie in lava, and of coral and tortoiseshell.
At Mr. Sommer’s Fine Art Establishment near the Chiaja,
a large collection of beautiful photographs of almost all
places in Italy is to be found. These are very moderate
in price&mdash;the cheapest in Italy&mdash;as well as good, and in
number exceed five thousand. I laid in a good stock, and
only wish I had taken more. Any of them can be at once
procured by reference to the number they bear. They are
best kept flat, but if rolling be preferred, they should always
be rolled up with the photograph side outwards. Why it is
that photographs of a size which cost a shilling at Naples
should be charged five shillings or six shillings, or even
more, at home, I don’t know. But the consequence is
that people buy the Italian photographs by the hundred,
whereas at home, if they buy at all, it is by the unit. Our
dealers plainly miss the market by their high prices. Mr.
Sommer might do well to extend his operations to the
towns of France and to Switzerland, where photographs are
expensive.</p>

<p>Among other shops we also visited Squadrilli’s, which is
recommended in Bædeker. Here we found a well-stocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
store of articles in lava and coral, but owing, I suppose,
to the thieving which exists in Naples, and from which,
no doubt, they have sometimes suffered, we were rather
unpleasantly watched by three persons, a circumstance of
which others who had been there also complained. The
articles, however, seemed to be good, while the prices are
fixed, though a discount of five per cent, was allowed for
cash. The gold used in Naples for bijouterie is considered
to be inferior to the standard quality of England, and even
of Rome, which professes to be, like England, of eighteen
carats. Squadrilli allowed that their gold was only fourteen
carats, and perhaps his estimate might not apply to all his
articles. There are many imitations, however, even of this
inferior gold, and some articles, possibly ‘job lots,’ are sold
in Naples at astonishingly low prices. The articles supposed
to be of lava are, I believe, in reality cut out of the
limestone rocks of Somma, one of the peaks of Vesuvius.</p>

<p class="p2">We were anxious to make our stay in Naples as short as
possible, as so much is heard of its insalubrity. After the
general survey we had thus made of it, we took train to
Castellamare, the railway passing Mount Vesuvius on the
one side and the coast on the other, so that we were in view
of the bay nearly all the way. Castellamare is a convenient
halting-place for seeing Pompeii, which, however,
may be visited from Naples itself, either by hiring a
carriage from Naples,&mdash;making a pretty long drive, and,
I believe, of little interest, the road being a continuous
street of houses,&mdash;or by taking the train as far as Torre dell’
Annunciata, and a carriage thence to Pompeii, which is not
two miles off. Castellamare is one of those populous
unclean towns which lie upon the bay. Friends had said
it was a remarkably nice place to stop at, and the Hotel
Quisisana, on the height above the town, is a fairly
comfortable one, commanding a splendid view of the bay,
of Vesuvius, and of Naples beyond. Perhaps we did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
remain long enough to acquire a knowledge of its beauties,
but we were not taken with the dirty town; while the
garden of the hotel, which might have been laid out to
great advantage, and thus have helped to reconcile us to
the place, was no better than such Italian gardens usually
are. I suppose that Nature has been so lavish of her
bounties when the sun shines, that the Italians think it
unnecessary to supplement her labours. Yet I have sometimes
thought that the time of waiters, who between meals
in foreign places have often little to do, might, not unprofitably
to the hotels, and with some advantage in health
to themselves, be occupied in trimming the hotel gardens.
Our bedrooms looked towards the bay, and therefore were,
I presume, considered more choice; but being a northern or
north-western exposure, we found them extremely cold at
night. It was, however, intensely interesting to look across
to Vesuvius, which I had seen emitting a red light on our
second evening at Naples, without being aware, unfortunately,
till afterwards that this light was unusual, and that had I
watched it for half an hour longer I should have seen it
become more intensely bright. People were then in full
expectation of an eruption, and even the very day had
been predicted, although the premonitory symptoms of
streams drying up had not appeared; but expectation was
not gratified.</p>

<p class="p2">We arranged the following morning to drive to Pompeii,
which is about three miles distant.</p>

<p>Pompeii on being approached seems like a huge mound,
somewhat akin in the distance to a fortified place. The
excavated town itself is not visible from the road. The
visitor is deposited at the door of what appears to be a
sort of tavern or place of refreshment, through which,
threading one’s way among tables, entrance is had to the
excavations. We found the tavern filled with people
taking an early dinner, or rather breakfast, rendering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
access by no means an agreeable one. Here leaving with
the <i>cameriere</i> our wraps,&mdash;not without some misgivings,
fortunately not realized, that we should never see them
again,&mdash;we passed up a stair, and through a magazine for
sale of lava ornaments, etc., the prices asked for which, as
usual in show places, were exorbitantly and forbiddingly
high. Outside the magazine we paid two francs each for
admission and for the assistance of a guide (children being
charged only a half-franc each), and procured a little French-speaking
guide in smart uniform and side arms, whom we
found very obliging and attentive. These guides are necessary,
and must be taken, though sometimes respectable
people who have been there before are allowed to go
without them; perhaps not always with advantage to the
ruins, as it is a very common trick with people who
should know better, and who might not be expected to do
such a thing, to pocket stones which can be of no use
whatever to themselves, but the abstraction of which is
detrimental to the place whence they are taken. On one
occasion in Italy, a lady of a party in which I was&mdash;who
acknowledged to being in the habit of bringing away
a stone from every place to which she had been&mdash;quietly
pocketed a piece of marble lying on the ground, when the
custodier, who was keeping a sharp look-out, went up to
her and desired her to replace it. It was a numbered
piece, and he would, he said, be responsible for it to the
authorities. The practice of chipping stones from a
building of note, or taking up loose pieces, cannot be too
severely reprehended, and ought sometimes to be punished.
The guides at Pompeii are not allowed to receive any
gratuity from the visitors, but they make a little by an
accorded permission to sell photographs of the ruins.</p>

<p>Passing through an old gateway, we were ushered into a
museum, the contents of which are not numerous, as the
bulk of the articles found is sent to the large Museum of
Naples. It contains, however, some things of great interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
particularly the casts of men and women found in Pompeii
who had perished in the great overthrow, and whose bodies
had been so curiously enveloped with the scoriæ as to form
a close-fitting, indurated mould, and a cast from it, when
the dust is blown out, reproduces every line of the body
or of the clothing of the suffocated person. Some of the
casts so taken give a clear representation of the form of the
features; and I noticed that the dress of the men seemed
to be very similar to what is still worn by those in the
vicinity, particularly in the tight-fitting, wrought woollen
jacket covering the body. If I was right in this supposition,
it is another instance of the manner in which the
people cling to ancient habits and modes of dress.</p>

<p>We were then taken to the excavations which are being
systematically carried on, and our examination commenced
with the forum, a large open space, containing the remains
of the pillars by which it was surrounded. From these
remains and the remains of other public buildings, it is
evident that Pompeii was a very elegantly adorned city.
It had temples, no less than nine being marked upon the
plan, but they are all in ruins; only fragments exist, the
pillars and superincumbent building having been almost
everywhere thrown down. In some of them, such as the
temple of Venus and temple of Isis, a few columns, with
their entablature, stand, to indicate the beauty of their construction.
Besides temples there have been excavated two
theatres and a large amphitheatre, in excellent preservation,
capable of accommodating 20,000 persons, and nearly, in
length and breadth, as large as that at Nismes; also, as
usual in Roman towns, baths, besides other public buildings.
But probably the greatest interest attaches to the remains
of the private dwellings. It is rarely that private houses
exhibit, after a lapse of nearly 2000 years, even in ruins,
what they were when in occupation. Here, however, the
lava or scoriæ or dust of Vesuvius by hermetical seal closed
up these houses, in order that they might be seen by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
people of a long-distant age. Many of the houses in
Pompeii belonged to men of wealth, and they are all laid
out, in the better class at least, upon much the same plan,
entering upon a square court, open in the centre to the
outer air, in the middle of which a marble fountain played.
The rooms were built around or beyond, the principal
or public rooms being to the back&mdash;a mode of design
probably suitable to the climate, at least in summer, and
admitting, no doubt, of great elegance of arrangement and
design, and of which such houses as those of Marcus
Holconius, of the Faun, of Sallust, of the poet, of Meleager,
and of Cornelius Rufus afford examples,&mdash;all containing
beautiful fluted pillars and other decorations, sometimes in
marble, still standing, while the walls were tastefully decorated
with that peculiar description of painting well known
as Pompeian. Some of the houses appear to be only one
storey high, but stairs indicate a second storey, and it is
even supposed that in some cases there may have been a
third. But they had no appearance to the street, while the
streets themselves are narrow, so much so that it is impossible
to see how in many of them even the smallest
carriages could pass each other without encroaching on the
equally narrow footway or <i>trottoir</i> (discovery of the remains
of it here revealing its use in ancient times); but the large
stones or slabs forming the street pavement are in some
places marked with a deep rut, indicating a good deal of
carriage traffic. The shops on the streets are small, and are
sometimes built into the dwellings, so that shop floors then
were probably as remunerative as they seem to be now
with ourselves, although persons now in similar rank of
life in Great Britain would little like to allow a portion of
their mansions to be so occupied. As, however, the streets
were so confined, there could have been no view from the
house itself upon the front facing the street; yet, no doubt,
from some windows in the upper apartments behind there
might be fine glimpses of the bay and of Vesuvius, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
as of the surrounding country. At all events, we obtained
excellent views from the ruins, especially from the walls.
Vesuvius appears close at hand, and one feels astonished at
the foolhardiness of people building towns and houses so
close under the fiery mountain after the tremendous warnings
received in the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
We were shown at one place in the ‘House of
Diomede’ a long vault or cellar, in which the remains were
found of seventeen unfortunate persons who had taken
refuge there during the awful time when they knew not
where to flee, and supposed that the walls of the house
would cover them from calamity. We could not look upon
such places without thinking what an appalling time it
must have been, and what heartrending agonies must then
have been endured. Notwithstanding all the elegance of
the public portions of the houses, and perhaps even of the
private chambers, it seemed as if the actual comfort of the
inhabitants could not be great, and especially in the matter
of bedroom accommodation, for I imagine the sleeping-rooms
were of the smallest dimensions&mdash;mere closets, not such as
people of the present day in good circumstances would
approve.</p>

<p class="p2">It would, however, be impossible, in small compass, to
give any adequate idea of these houses or of their decorations.
Books have been written upon the subject, and an
excellent recent account of Pompeii, its history, buildings,
and antiquities, containing nearly 300 illustrations, has
been written by Dr. Thomas H. Dyer. Nothing, indeed,
but a visit to Pompeii itself can convey a sufficient idea of
the resuscitated city; but a study of Mr. Dyer’s book before
going, as well as after a visit, will help materially to an
understanding of it. Pompeii is a place of engrossing
interest entirely unique, and in some respects it offers, I
think, more attractions to a visitor than any other in Italy,
and well merits more than one visit. The excavations are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
still proceeding, and it will probably be many years before
they are completed, as there is still a large piece of ground,
probably as much again as has already been opened, on
which to operate.</p>

<p class="p2">Having seen Pompeii, we did not care to stay longer at
Castellamare, and next day, taking a carriage with three
horses, the bells jingling cheerily all the way, drove to
Sorrento. The drive occupied an hour and a half, and is
considered to be one of the finest to be had in Italy. The
road borders the bay, and passes through several large
Italian villages most picturesquely situated, and across a
deep ravine, evidently the result of an earthquake, by a
beautiful bridge. Sorrento is a long town, and the road
through its suburbs is shut in by lofty and most objectionable
garden walls. As we drove down the road towards it,
from the height to the eastward the place looked very
charming, surrounded by hills on every side except the
north, which is open to the sea. Turning down a long
narrow lane, we arrived at the Tramontano Hotel (kept by
an Irish landlady, an active and most obliging woman),
where everything is remarkably comfortable, and the accommodation
is ample. It is situated on classic ground, Tasso
having resided in a house which, or its site, is now part
of the hotel. A garden, where, no doubt, Tasso often
meditated, encloses the hotel upon the south, while the
north windows and terraces command magnificent views of
the bay, of the islands, of Naples lying opposite, and of
Vesuvius, whose smoke, always ascending, is an excellent
indicator of the direction of the wind. The garden extends
away to the eastward, where a dependence or additional
house is kept for the accommodation of the guests. A
large public room, with windows to the bay, was being
added to the main house, so that now both <i>salon</i> and <i>salle-à-manger</i>
are large rooms. Having had experience of the
cold of northerly chambers at Castellamare, we chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
cheerful rooms on the south side overlooking the hotel
yard, with all its enlivening bustle, and the garden and
green hills behind.</p>

<p class="p2">Sorrento lies upon a platform or broad level space of land,
the seaward side being high perpendicular cliffs, so that
one looks sheer down from the hotel windows on the north
to the water far below, which is reached from the hotel
by a winding tunnel cut into the rock. It is placed, like
Mentone, under the guard of a semicircle of hills, although
these are both nearer and much lower than those at Mentone;
but as the town faces the north, instead of the south
as at Mentone, it is rather a summer than a winter residence.
We had it very cold there during the night, but
in the glowing mid-day sun it was charming to look out
upon the water and land, and see everything bathed in an
atmosphere of light, while vegetation was now beginning
to advance, lending an additional charm to the landscape.
We were not, however, altogether without rain. One night
was particularly stormy and wet.</p>

<p class="p2">There are excursions from Sorrento upon the hills which
can be accomplished by aid of donkeys, and it is also
possible to cross over the hills to Amalfi, though this was
not reckoned altogether safe from bandits. Boats can be
had for boating, but the main excursions are by steamboat
to Capri, and driving to Massa, a picturesque town a few
miles westward; the road to it by the coast being a continuation
of that from Castellamare, and affording lovely
views at every turn. The excursion to Capri is made by
steamboat, and every fine morning two rival steamers (a
paddle and a screw boat) from Naples approached Sorrento
to take excursionists to Capri and its blue grotto. In addition
to the fare there and back of 5 francs, innumerable
other little charges for boats, etc. make the expense up to
8 francs each. When the sea is stormy, the boats do not
go, as it is impossible to enter the grotto when there is the
least swell upon the water. This is annoying to unlucky
persons who are left on the island, as it sometimes happens
in consequence that the boats may not leave Naples for weeks
together. I met on board the steamer two American
friends who had come from Naples, were to sleep a night
at Capri and return the next day, having taken their
passage for the day following in a steamer for Genoa. The
next day, however, proved stormy, and the steamboats did
not make their appearance for several days afterwards, so
that our friends must have been kept prisoners on the
island and lost their passage besides. We had, however, a
very beautiful day for the trip, the steamboat taking about
two hours to reach Capri from Sorrento, and it was most
enjoyable. The views from the deck are enchanting.
When we arrived off the grotto, the vessel was surrounded
by a multitude of little boats; and as three persons only are
allowed to each, it took a long time for all the visitors to
get off. The sea where the steamer stopped was of a most
lovely blue colour, perhaps due to some great local saltness
of the ocean. On approaching the entrance to the grotto,
all were desired to lie down on the bottom of the boat,
otherwise, by catching the crest of a wave, we might have
broken our heads against the rocks of the entrance, which
is very low,&mdash;although it might, one would think, be
enlarged,&mdash;while the boatmen carefully pushed the boat
inside. Once we were in, however, there was space enough
for several boats to paddle about. We found everything
bathed in the blue light of the sea reflected on the walls of
the cavern. It is this which gives the name to the grotto.
The rocks themselves are just ordinary colour, and do not,
as might from the name be supposed, consist, like those of
the blue John Cavern of Derbyshire, of actual blue spar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>When all had seen the grotto, the steamboats took us to
the town of Capri, which, with another on the hill, is picturesque.
There are good hotels near the landing-place. A long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ascent leads to the high town, near which the palace of
Tiberius once stood. From the height I had a view of the
southern coast of Italy; but the day was hot, and the atmosphere
therefore hazy, so that we could not see far. We
returned to Sorrento in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="p2">Sorrento is a great place&mdash;in fact, the chief place&mdash;for
the manufacture of articles of inlaid wood. It is the
industry of the town, and everywhere we found workshops
for its manufacture, having attached to them shops for its
sale, although, I presume, the larger part of the manufacture
is for export or transmission elsewhere. As may be supposed,
there is considerable diversity of skill among the
workmen, and many articles exhibit inferiority; but I soon
found out in which shops the best workmanship prevailed,
and in particular considered the articles manufactured
by M. Grandville were both well finished and wrought
in good taste. Garguilo also, who has a more imposing
establishment, had some very fine specimens of work.
Every visitor buys more or less, principally, doubtless, to
take home as gifts to friends, and I did not escape the
contagion. Some of the articles are extremely beautiful;
and one I secured, which seemed to be one of the finest
examples, was so delicately inlaid that at first sight it
seemed as if it were a painting on the wood. I saw, however,
the process by which the inlaying is effected, which
satisfied me with the reality of the inlaying. A picture is
drawn on paper, and little pieces, corresponding in colour to
the pattern, are cut out of larger coloured pieces with an
extremely slender steel saw&mdash;almost a thread for fineness.
These are glued down upon the pattern so closely that the
joinings are invisible, and it is in the comparative skill
with which this nice operation is conducted I presume
the difference of quality and effect is mainly found. In
purchasing these articles, however, one has not to lose
sight of the fact that the transaction is taking place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the South of Italy, and sometimes a considerably higher
price is asked than the seller is prepared to take. I had
the specimens purchased put in a box, carefully packed, to
send from Naples home by sea, and found on entering
Naples that <i>octroi</i> duty upon it was exacted, and this not
according to value, but to weight. The wood shops are
among the best in Sorrento, but I was struck with the marvellous
likeness there was, in size at least, in the common
small shops of Sorrento to what had been shops in Pompeii.</p>

<p class="p2">We led a quiet life very pleasantly among friends and
acquaintances at the hotel in Sorrento for about a fortnight,
glad of rest after so much previous sight-seeing; but the
hotel was always full, and the constant jingling of horses’
bells, denoting the arrival or departure of carriages, kept it
lively, while, among other diversions, we witnessed the
Tarantala dancing entertainment, to which I have elsewhere
alluded (p. 72). We had at first thought of going to Cava,
with a view to taking trips thence to Amalfi and Pæstum;
but preferring rest, left that, like many other excursions, to
another opportunity, which might never come. We returned
to Naples on 11th April, having a glorious day for
the return drive to Castellamare. The trees were only
budding, so that we did not see things in perfection. As
we drove out of the hotel yard, a man, neither clothed in
plush and fine linen nor recently washed, jumped up and
sat on the luggage behind, an undesirable-looking and unengaged
lackey. The driver explained it was to guard the
luggage, which sometimes, I believe, is, by the nimble-fingered
inhabitants of the bay, quietly abstracted if not
well roped. It was only, however, a genteel method of
begging for 30 centimes, with which at Castellamare he was
well satisfied. The beggars of Sorrento are certainly
industrious in their calling. I stayed a few minutes at one
place to make a little sketch, and was immediately surrounded
by half-a-dozen women, and at least as many children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
all wanting copper. One regular beggar, a man, old to
appearance, who was constantly sauntering about, stick in
hand, amused me much. His address was, as you approached
him, arrestively and decisively, ‘Signor!’ You proceeded a
yard farther, and it was more decisively, or rather imperatively,
‘Signor!’ You passed him, and it was ‘Signor!
Signor!’ (weepingly) ‘povero vecc. he he per amor di Dio,’
a phrase generally employed by the Italian beggars. It is,
however, but fair to add, that begging in Italy is not nearly
so bad as it once was, for the authorities are setting their
face against it. Still, in some places, it is a great annoyance
that one cannot walk along the streets of a small town
like Sorrento without being assailed by the same everlasting
beggar, giving to whom only encourages to ask again.</p>

<p class="p2">We were anxious upon our return to Naples to have
ascended Vesuvius, at least as far as the Observatory, but
unfortunately a heavy cloud hung over the mountain, and
reluctantly we had to give it up. Instead, we took a drive
to Puteoli, or, as it is now called, Pozzuoli, about two hours
distant. Our way lay through the grotto of Posilipo, which
is lighted up with gas, and is about a third of a mile long,
about 21 feet wide, and varies in height from 70 to 25 feet;
thence along an uninteresting road till again we reached the
sea, when the islands and Puteoli looked very picturesque.
One could hardly imagine from its appearance that it was
formerly a great Roman port; but it has been subjected
to many changes, and bears evidence of the forces below
agitating the ground, by which some parts have been alternately
submerged and upheaved, and the recurrence of such
events would be sufficient of themselves to account for its
desertion. Here we drove over the southern termination of
the Appian Way, paved with the large old Roman stones;
and our coachman pointed out the part of the old Roman
pier (now in fragments, like a row of giant stepping-stones
lifting their heads above water) at which he alleged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Apostle Paul had landed. There are some ruined temples
in Puteoli and its neighbourhood, and the ruins of a large
amphitheatre, which the guide said had held 45,000, but,
as is more credibly stated by others, 25,000 spectators,
for it is not so large or so imposing as that at Nismes,
while the measurements are considerably less,&mdash;Nismes
exceeding it in length by 75 feet, and in breadth by 120
feet. Chambers underneath were discovered in 1838, and
are very interesting. They contained dens for the confinement
of the wild beasts, and rooms where the
gladiators were trained to fight. We had, previous to
entering Puteoli, taken a side road to Solfatara. This is a
scarcely extinct crater, supposed to have a direct communication
underground with Vesuvius, twelve miles distant.
However, there has been no eruption since 1198, when it
sent forth a current of lava. A man who appeared as guide
threw a heavy stone upon the probably thin crust of
sulphurous matter constituting the ground over which we
were treading; the reverberation from the fall indicated that
it was hollow below, and in all likelihood a slender protection
from a fiery furnace which it might not be safe to
expose to the air and light of day. And as Solfatara is
quiescent when Vesuvius is active, and active when
Vesuvius is quiescent, which it then was, the thought, as
we were intruding upon the domains of these angry
forces of nature, that some sudden impulse might burst
the earthy covering and blow us all up into the air, like Paul
Pry peering about the steamboat when the boiler burst,
was not comfortable. The guide took us to a hole from
which sulphurous fumes were issuing, and for a few
coppers entered it at some risk of suffocation, and by
means of a long stick pulled out some pieces of hot
sulphur from the boiling natural caldron, which we carried
off as souvenirs of our visit to a place which some day may
become the scene of a terrible disaster.</p>

<p>Taking a different route on returning, we passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
supposed tomb of Virgil; and crossing over the hill, came
again in sight at some distance of Naples, and the continuous
stretch of houses along the coast to the southward.
Altogether it was a very interesting drive. Had we had
time for it, we should have gone farther, as far as to Baiæ,
which is a few miles beyond Puteoli.</p>

<p class="p2">As illustrative of the method of selling and clutching at
a profit, however small, I may here mention that, going out
with a friend from the hotel, we were waylaid by boys
offering walking-sticks for sale. The first boy asked 2
francs for a cane, my friend offered 1 franc, and it was
at once taken. Thereupon another with much better canes
came up. My friend picked out five of the best, for which
he was asked 15 francs, and they were really very cheap at
the money. He offered 5 francs and then 6, and to throw
in the stick he had just bought of the other boy. The
offer was at once closed with, so that he got for 7 francs
five beautiful canes, which, judging from prices asked in the
shops, were worth 20 francs at least.</p>

<p class="p2">We had still a good deal to see in Naples; but, not feeling
very well, we were anxious to leave a place the reputation
of which for salubrity is by no means assuring, and departed
for Rome by a morning train, leaving at 7 o’clock and
arriving before 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p class="pch"><i>FLORENCE, BOLOGNA.</i></p>

<h3>FLORENCE.</h3>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> stayed in Rome until 27th April, when we left for
Florence. We had intended going round by the attractive
town of Perugia, but the morning of the 26th was wet, and,
delaying our departure for a day, we gave up Perugia,
partly because to have gone upon a Friday would have
involved spending a Sunday there. The latter part of our
journey was interesting. On arriving at the outskirts of
the town the railway circumnavigates it, so that we had an
opportunity from the very first of seeing the cathedral dome
and campanile, and the other towers and spires of Florence,
which lies beautifully situated in a luxuriantly verdant
valley, enclosed by the Apennines and other hills, and
intersected by the river Arno, which, seeing for the first
time in the soft moonlight in the course of the evening,
looked so lovely.</p>

<p>The Lung’ Arno, or bank of the river, where most of the
principal hotels are placed, is considered the best situation,
at least for winter residence. Some of the hotels are unpleasantly
near a waterfall or wear stretching across the
river, the incessant din of which is troublesome at night.
We spent a few nights at one of the hotels there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
afterwards a fortnight at the Pension Molini Barbensi<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, on
the left bank of the river, where we found pleasant society
and some former travelling acquaintances. The house is
a good one, and the rooms are large, but a very little
expenditure on sanitary arrangements would improve it as
a residence. Living seems not to be expensive at Florence,
and lodgings can be procured at a moderate rate.</p>

<p class="p2">Florence lies upon the same river as Pisa, but I suppose
fifty or sixty miles farther up, and the town bears some
resemblance to it, but is far more picturesque and far
more lively and populous. In fact, Pisa is quite a dull,
quiet, dead-alive town beside it. The population of Florence,
at present about 170,000, is four times as great as that of
Pisa, and it has been a royal town as well as a provincial
capital. The river is crossed by six bridges (three, or rather
four of them, of very old date) connecting the north and
south portions of the city, which, however, lies mainly
upon the north shore. Of these bridges (all strongly
buttressed against the force of the river, which no doubt
occasionally descends in floods with great power), the Ponte
Vecchio is peculiar and picturesque, and a remnant of old
times, being covered on each side with houses, and on one
side, on the top floor, by the long gallery which connects
the Uffizi and Pitti Palaces. These houses on the bridge
are very curious. Next the street they present to view on
both sides small booths or stalls, principally occupied by
goldsmiths or jewellers, which very likely much resemble
what the shops of Old London were, but at the present
day do not, for jewellers’ wares, inspire confidence. On
the other or river sides, all manner of chambers in or on
the wall project, jut out, and overhang the river, very
perilous to behold, and suggestive of <i>oubliettes</i> through
which murdered travellers on the bridge might be quietly
dropped into the river below, but conferring a quaintness
of appearance precious in the sight of the artist. Equally
striking in effect is an adjoining range of buildings on the
left bank&mdash;also flanking the river, and with their projecting
chambers overhanging it. In the centre of the bridge large
arched openings enable the passer-by to look up and down
the river, and take in the prospect beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all along both sides of the Arno (protected by
parapet walls) a wide street runs, and the buildings lining
it are some of them stately and handsome, others are old or
massive or peculiar, while the line is diversified here and
there by a spire or a curious tower. The remarkable lofty old
tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, and the dome and campanile
of the cathedral,&mdash;all such notable objects in the pictures
of Florence,&mdash;are prominent from almost every part, but
especially from the south side of the river. There are,
however, certain points of view from which Florence can
be commanded. One of these is the terrace of the church
of San Miniato, which stands upon a hill to the south-east,
and is reached by a very delightful winding road bordered
by villas, which were all at the time of our visit looking
very charming in their new drapery of spring foliage.
The church is an old one, finely decorated with marble
and mosaics and marble pillars, and possessing a large
crypt below. In itself it is well worth seeing, but it is
principally visited for the sake of the prospect. Looking
down from the terrace in front, Florence, with dome and
towers, is seen lying away below very compactly in the
centre of a long, large, flat plain, cut in two by the river, and
surrounded by hills. It has here a fresher and cleaner look
than most Italian towns. Immediately below San Miniato
the piazza named after Michael Angelo lies, adorned in the
centre by that artist’s famous colossal statue of David.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
The smart terraces of this nicely laid-out piazza command
views similar to those from San Miniato, but from a lower
elevation. A different winding road, as pleasant as the
other, conducts down to the town.</p>

<p class="p2">Another fine drive is to the very ancient town of Fiesole,
which stands on a hill upon the north side, and is about
three miles out of town. There is here a curious old
church or cathedral, with pillars said to be of the first
century. Ascending a hill a little higher, and probably
1000 feet above the sea, the view from the top is more commanding
than that of San Miniato, and one sees the Arno
winding its way for a long distance down the valley, and the
Carrara Mountains in the distance. These and other drives
about the suburbs of Florence give the impression of a very
charming place for a spring residence; but Florence is hot
in summer and often very cold in winter time, fierce winds
blowing from the hills, which I suppose are frequently
covered with snow. The older portions of the city are
similar to most Italian towns, full of narrow, tortuous
streets; but adjoining the river and in the newer portions,
and in the outskirts, the streets are regular and comparatively
wide, with piazzas or open spaces in several parts.
There are wide, handsome boulevards or <i>viales</i> encircling
the city. In the Piazza Cavour there is a graceful
triumphal arch akin to that in the Tuileries of Paris. At
the west end, and adjoining the Arno, a large public park
extends, called the Cascine, in which are long avenues
bordered by trees, affording room for delightful drives and
walks, one portion being also laid out as a racecourse.
In the quarter south of the Arno the Boboli Gardens
attached to the Royal Pitti Palace are also extensive, but
open to the public only on Sundays and Thursdays.</p>

<p class="p2">Florence, historically, is a place of great interest, and is
associated with many great names. It is the birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of, among others, Dante, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Galileo,
Michael Angelo Buonarotti, Cimabue, Fra Angelico, Leonardo
da Vinci, Carlo Dolci, and others eminent in art.
The houses of some of these celebrities are pointed out.</p>

<p>I can imagine that to those who spend a winter in
Florence it must be exceedingly interesting to study the
history of the place, and read on the spot such entertaining
books as the remarkable life of that most remarkable man,
Benvenuto Cellini, giving, as it does, such an insight into
Italian life in the sixteenth century. Machiavelli, who
died in 1527, brings his history down only to the year
1492; but after reading Trollope’s history, in four vols.,
Napier’s in six (leaving off at the year 1824) will afford
for a whole winter a sufficiently tough <i>pièce de résistance</i>,
the perusal whereof one’s physician would no doubt recommend
should be diversified occasionally by a chapter
in Mrs. Oliphant’s <i>Makers of Florence</i>, or by George
Eliot’s <i>Romola</i>, which it is to be hoped was not drawn
from the life.</p>

<p class="p2">Florence, although in itself a more desirable place of residence
than Rome, has no Roman ruins. It possesses, however,
very many objects of great interest. There are within it
about ninety churches, not a few of which are attractive.</p>

<p>The cathedral, commenced about six hundred years ago,
and in its façade not yet finished, is immense, being 556
feet long by 342 feet wide. The spirit in which it was
originated was lofty, the Florentine Republic desiring ‘that
an edifice should be constructed so magnificent in its height
and beauty that it shall surpass everything of the kind
produced in the time of their greatest power by the Greeks
and Romans.’ It is, at least in external covering, composed
of marble&mdash;white, black, and green&mdash;with many
sculptures and carvings in the marble, especially about the
doorways. The stones are laid on a species of panelling
consisting of upright parallelograms broken by large, formal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
circular openings. Though it be somewhat stiff in pattern,
and may be objected to as piebald, a certain richness of
effect is produced. But the interior is not correspondent
with the exterior; it is vast, but too bare and empty, and
dark and dingy&mdash;perhaps, therefore, the more sublime!
Looking up from below into the magnificent dome, it seems
an enormous height to the lantern; as it no doubt is, being
352 feet&mdash;so high, in fact, that the dome itself is higher
than that of St. Peter’s, although the highest pinnacle is
not. In design and general effect, as a whole, the cathedral
will not compare with the great temple of Rome. The
campanile or bell tower which adjoins, but is separated
from it, is of marvellous beauty, and stands nearly 300 feet
high. It is a perpendicular square tower, built of every kind
of coloured marble, adorned by statuary and covered with
rich alto-relievos (of which photographs can be procured);
also by the graceful windows, very charmingly decorated
in a species of suitable tracery. There is a completeness
about this tower, even though it lacks the spire with which
Giotto intended it to be crowned, combined with an
exuberant affluence of decoration, which renders it a delightful
object of contemplation, or rather, I should say, a choice
object of study.</p>

<p class="p2">On the side of the piazza opposite to the west front the
baptistery stands, an octagonal building 94 feet in diameter,
and in one of the entrances the celebrated bronze gates are
placed. We often availed ourselves of opportunities to
examine these beautiful embodiments in bronze of Scripture
subjects. Being exposed to the street, they are laden
with dust, which to a certain extent reduces their apparent
sharpness. Over this entrance gate there is a representation
of the baptism of Jesus in three sculptured figures&mdash;our
Lord, John the Baptist, and an attendant angel. Inside
the baptistery, besides its oriental granite columns and its
mosaics, there is nothing very remarkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>On the south side of the cathedral, in the piazza, we
found the little church of the Misericordia, belonging to
that peculiar body of monks who, dressed in long black
cloaks, with black masks over their faces pierced by eyeholes,
are to be occasionally seen going about Florence and
elsewhere in procession with the dead, which they bury,
taking thus the place of the relations, who, in some parts
of Italy, seem to abandon their friends when they die, and
appear regardless of what becomes of their remains. We
saw the chapel upon Ascension Day, which was a great
holiday, or, to speak more exactly, <i>holy</i> day in Florence.
On that occasion it was, like other churches, crammed to
the door with a changing audience, and, after pushing our
way in, we were as glad to push our way out again.</p>

<p>The churches of Santa Croce, S.S. Annunciata, Santa Maria
Novella, and San Lorenzo are among the finest. They
contain beautiful marble monuments, altar paintings, and
other decorations which it would be endless to mention.
The large church of Santa Croce has a fine white and black
marble façade&mdash;rather straight and angular, however, in its
lines. It measures nearly 500 feet long, and the interior,
besides being adorned, as usual, with pictures, is the great
receptacle of monuments to illustrious Florentine men, such
as Michael Angelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli. The cloisters
adjoining the church are well worthy of a visit. Most of the
important churches in Florence have the advantage of a
large open piazza in front. The vacant space surrounding
the cathedral, unfortunately, is comparatively insignificant,
and it were well if it could be enlarged. That in front of
Santa Croce is large, and is adorned by a colossal marble
statue of Dante in classic robe, attended by an eagle and
guarded by four lions placed at the corners of a suitable
pedestal.</p>

<p class="p2">From the church of San Lorenzo, founded in the fourth
century, and one of the oldest churches in Italy, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
conducted by a touting guide to the adjacent chapel of the
Medici,&mdash;the princes of Florence,&mdash;and the tombs of these
princes, erected at a cost of nearly £900,000. The chapel
contains Michael Angelo’s masterpieces in sculpture&mdash;Lorenzo
de Medici as a warrior resting, but ready, while
Day and Night personified recline below, and on the opposite
side Julian de Medici sits pondering over recumbent
Dawn and Twilight. Opinions, however, have differed as
to which is Lorenzo and which is Julian, and I am
afraid the visitor has, like the little boy, to ‘take his
choice.’</p>

<p class="p2">The monastery, formerly of the Silvestrine, afterwards
the Dominican monks, now the Museum of San Marco, is
close to the church of San Marco. Here are to be seen a
great many paintings by the pure-minded Fra (Giovanni)
Angelico, who resided in the monastery during the first
half of the fifteenth century. All his works, wrought out
in prayer, are distinguished by the beautiful though smooth
painting of the faces, many of which, here and elsewhere in
Florence, are angelic, or, as we might more correctly designate
them, of a saintly, soft beauty, and composed, devout
inexpressiveness of any passion, but peculiar both in attire
and employment. It would be a mistake, however, to set
down all Angelo’s faces as of this description, as in some
of his paintings there is great diversity of contour and of
expression, although the drawing is often singular and in
the pre-Raphaelite style. I suppose it is generally correct,
although not always. In one instance I noticed that a
neck seemed to be a linked sweetness rather long drawn
out. There is likewise shown in this museum, which is in
reality a range of monkish cells, the little cell in which
Savonarola, the illustrious, eloquent prior of the order, lived,&mdash;a
man of great force of character, a precursor of Luther,
fearless as Knox, and a saviour of Florence, whose people,
when they burnt him at the stake, put to death their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
greatest benefactor. In a large room were exhibited an
immense collection of the flags, banners, and colours of all
the towns and corporations of Italy which were represented
at the Dante festival in 1865.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river, with the exception of
Minesota, the churches do not appear to be so fine; but
there is one, the church of San Spirito, which is large and
attractive, and contains no less than thirty-eight chapels
encircling it&mdash;by far the largest number of side chapels
attached to a church I have seen anywhere.</p>

<p class="p2">The visitor, however, is at first most attracted by the
Piazza della Signoria, which&mdash;the centre of business&mdash;is a
large open space, wherein, or in its neighbourhood, some of
the most important buildings are congregated. On the
south side of this piazza there is a lofty, covered, arcaded
hall, called the Loggia dei Lanzi, open on two sides to the
street by arches resting upon high ornamental pillars. Here
are arranged some of the most beautiful modern statues in
Florence, including the Rape of the Sabines in marble, by
Giovanni da Bologna&mdash;a spirited work, which, like some of
the others, is constantly being copied on a small scale in
marble and alabaster, for sale in the shops; and Perseus, a
bronze statue by Benvenuto Cellini, a master of whose works
there are various specimens to be seen in Florence. Both
these stand in line with the front of the Loggia. Behind
them are several other groups, including the Rape of
Polyxena, Hercules slaying the Centaur, and one supposed
to represent Ajax dragging along the body of Patroclus or of
Achilles, all in fine powerful action. Tall, massive buildings
have been erected on another side of the square, and opposite
them, sentinelled by statues, the Palazzo Vecchio rises
grandly but grimly, with its conspicuous campanile towering
over everything around. This palace is well worthy of a
visit. Immediately within the doorway we found, in contrast
with the exterior, a graceful entrance court, encircled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
by an arcade supported by rows of columns florid in
arabesques, each differing from the others, and a small
fountain in the centre giving life to the whole. Ascending
a long stair, we were ushered into an enormous hall, ornamented
by six huge fresco paintings representing events in
the history of Italy. On a floor above we were shown a chapel
and several small rooms, in one of which there was a model
of the proposed façade of the cathedral. I suspect it will
be a long time before the façade itself be an accomplished
fact. It appears strange that it should be allowed to
remain in its present condition, a blemish upon the building,
and a reflection upon the spirit in which the erection was
commenced.</p>

<p class="p2">The house of Michael Angelo is not far from the Piazza.
It has been converted into a museum, and contains, besides
a series of paintings representative of events in his life,
with some of his drawings and models in wax, and a small
collection of works of art, a closet or studio in which he
wrought, and a portrait and statue of this extraordinary
artist and fiery independent man, conscious of a genius
as versatile as it was unrivalled. The high estimate in
which he has been held by those qualified to judge may
be seen by referring to Sir Joshua Reynolds’ <i>Discourses</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In another street an inscription upon a stone in the wall
denotes a house in which Benvenuto Cellini at one time
lived.</p>

<p class="p2">But the greatest sources of attraction in Florence are the
Uffizi and Pitti Galleries. These are open free to the
public on Sundays and Thursdays&mdash;on other days on payment
of a franc. The Uffizi Gallery occupies the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
floor of the three sides of a long narrow street or court or
<i>cul de sac</i>, I believe 450 feet long&mdash;the fourth being open to
the Piazza della Signoria. The building has a handsome
elevation, scarcely visible in the narrow street, and is
adorned by nearly thirty marble statues of celebrated
Tuscans, such as Dante, Petrarch, Michael Angelo, Lorenzo
il Magnifico, evidencing the wealth of Florence in illustrious
men. The gallery itself is reached by a long staircase, and
through vestibules embellished by busts and statues. On
entering we find ourselves in a long corridor, which is carried
round the whole length of the three sides of the building;
in fact, making three long galleries, not particularly high,
though high enough for the purpose, and lighted from
the top and by windows looking into the court. In these
corridors, besides a good many pictures interspersed upon
the walls, the greater part of the sculpture of the collection
is assembled&mdash;embracing some choice specimens of ancient
art, but in number very small compared with the vast
treasures of the Vatican. Doors open all round into suites
of rooms containing an immense assemblage of paintings,
principally Italian, and among them many of the choicest
works of the great masters. Besides the many chambers
devoted to works of art of various nations, among which
Britain seems to be nowhere and Italy to predominate,
there are some small rooms containing collections of gems,
medals, and bronzes. Two of the larger galleries exhibit
several hundred portraits of artists, one of the most pleasingly
beautiful among them being a sweet likeness by Mme.
Le Brun of herself, a very favourite subject of copy, and
with herself a not uncommon subject of her brush, as may
be noticed in the Louvre. A very large room is likewise
set apart mainly for the exhibition of seventeen most painfully-expressive
statues of the famous Niobe group. But
of all the rooms in this great gathering of art, the Tribune
is the one which displays the choicest specimens. It is a
comparatively small room, but is said to have cost £20,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
in its construction. Here are chef-d’&oelig;uvres of Raphael,
Titian, Guido Reni, Correggio, and various others; while
the chamber also contains the famous Venus de Medici, the
Wrestlers, the Dancing Faun, the Whetter&mdash;all masterpieces
of ancient sculpture.</p>

<p>Descending by a stair, the visitor proceeds by an almost
interminably long corridor, which stretches out to the Ponte
Vecchio, and across that bridge away to the Pitti Palace on
the south side of the Arno&mdash;I suppose scarcely less than
half a mile between the two places. This corridor, being
lined with engravings, with drawings of the masters, and
with tapestries,&mdash;a collection of things in themselves
valuable,&mdash;would take a long time to examine, but in
presence of so much else more attractive, scarcely succeeds
in alluring the passing visitor to any lengthened scrutiny.
Away and away it stretches, till after a weary walk it
comes to a termination, and ascending by another stair into
the Pitti Palace, we find ourselves in a collection of upwards
of five hundred paintings and a few sculptures, occupying
about fifteen different beautiful large rooms. It may truly
be said there is hardly a painting in these rooms which is
not good, while there are among them some of the choicest
works of the great masters, as, for example,&mdash;for it is but
one of very many which might be named,&mdash;Raphael’s
Madonna della Sedia, the beauty of which painting is
something wonderful. No engraving and no copy that
I have seen approaches the lovely expressiveness of the
original. I was several times in these galleries, in which
one could spend many days with the greatest enjoyment.
But to endeavour to write a description would be not
merely fruitlessly to seek to realize the works, but would
be to attempt a disquisition on the great in art, which,
even with capacity for the undertaking, would here be out
of place. I suppose there is not an Italian painter of
eminence who is not represented in the gallery, though
beyond native art I think the only other nations whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
artists’ works appear are the Dutch and Spanish. Photographs
and engravings can be procured of many of the
pictures in the shops.</p>

<p>At all times artists are engaged, in both the Uffizi and Pitti
Galleries, making copies of the more celebrated or most
attractive pictures&mdash;occasionally two upon the same picture;
and they do proceed with most wonderful patience
and infinite pains, copying to the minutest hair, and laying
on coat after coat with the greatest delicacy, some of them
attaining to great excellence. A <i>permesso</i> is necessary to
copy, and for some of the more celebrated paintings the
artists, I was told, had sometimes to wait their turn for
years. When they have, after elaborate painstaking, made
a good copy, I fancy they manufacture other copies from it.
I was fortunate enough, among others, to secure a copy of
the lovely Madonna del Cordellina by Raphael, so perfect
that it might almost vie with the original. It was obviously
a copy direct from, and inspired by, the original. Beside
it stood in the same shop another copy, but oh! how different!
I believe that some of the copiers attach themselves
more particularly to given masters,&mdash;for example,
one in general copies Titians, another Murillos, another
Raphaels. To protect against the abstraction of pictures
from the galleries, no one is allowed to take a picture, not
even a copy, out of Italy without a <i>permesso</i>. I bought a
small copy of a Titian in the galleries, and the artist
(Adolphe Boschi) accompanied me with it to the town,
because, he said, they would not have allowed me to pass
with it myself.</p>

<p>There is one little inconvenience attendant upon the
extreme length of the galleries. Upon occasion of my
first visit, I had unfortunately taken an umbrella, which I
was obliged to leave at the door of the Uffizi Gallery. After
wandering to the extreme end of the Pitti Gallery, I had
to retrace all my steps to regain this umbrella. It is
better, therefore, if anything must be left at the door, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
confine a visit to one or other of the palaces, and there is
abundance in either to engage a whole forenoon.</p>

<p class="p2">Not far from the Piazza della Signoria is what is called
the National Museum, contained in the old Palazzo del
Podesta, rich, but severely rich, in its architecture. The
ground floor is occupied with ancient and modern armour
and arms. Above there is a gallery of statues, some of
them by Michael Angelo, a room full of majolica, another
of ivory carvings, two of bronzes, two of tapestry, and two
of sculpture; but the collection, though interesting, looks
small after experiencing the extent of the Uffizi and Pitti
Galleries, and seems hardly deserving to be dignified with
the name of National.</p>

<p>The Corsini Palace, on the Lung Arno, is open three days
in the week to the public, and contains in twelve rooms a
large collection of paintings, many of which are by the
great masters.</p>

<p>The Academia delle Belle Arti contains a large collection
of pre-Raphaelites, commencing with Cimabue, and comprising
among others some fine Peruginos. It is accordingly
interesting. In an upper floor several rooms exhibit
paintings by modern Italian artists, principally battlepieces.
I paid a visit also to the rooms of the Association
for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, which seems to be
founded somewhat on the same principles as similar associations
in Great Britain; but from such opportunities as I
have had of forming an opinion, I cannot say that the
mantle of their great predecessors&mdash;whose works are constantly
before them, and might be thought calculated to
inspire&mdash;has fallen upon the modern Florentine artists.</p>

<p class="p2">Florence, besides being a great place for the sale of
copies of paintings, and for the manufacture of the well-known
massive and tastefully-decorated picture-frames,
all carved out of the solid wood, upon which the gilding is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
laid without any mixture of composition, is the place
of all others for the manufacture and sale of marble and
alabaster sculpture, and of the beautiful Florentine mosaic
jewellery. It is filled with shops for the sale of these
various articles, which are to be had at moderate prices,
and strangers seldom leave without more or less extensively
making purchases.</p>

<p class="p2">The streets of Florence are always full of life. Occasionally
of an evening a body of men, perhaps twenty or
thirty, would form themselves in a ring, and with deep,
rich, melodious voices sing Italian songs. The power of
voice or strength of lungs which the Italians sometimes
possess is indeed often exhibited in a surprising manner.
All of a sudden, walking along a street, it may be meditatively,
a vendor of small wares will abruptly at your very ear,
and without apparent effort, discharge a sharp, stentorian cry,
piercing and startling as with the shock of a nine-pounder,
and nearly knocking you down breathless and affrighted.
The markets, too, are noisy,&mdash;bargain-making being a serious
operation, in which success is supposed to attend the most
vociferous and energetic,&mdash;but sometimes they are more
quietly conducted. Having once penetrated them, and
found myself in the press of a great crowd in very narrow
passages, and in odious proximity to heaps of most unpleasant-looking
fish, it was with no little satisfaction I
made my escape as soon as escape was practicable.</p>

<p class="p2">There are many other places in Florence to be seen
besides those I have specially mentioned. We did see a
good deal in the time we were there, but not all by any
means, and what we did see was in a very general way.
We remained not quite three weeks, and could with
pleasure have stayed much longer. It is a place which,
like Rome, though not to the same extent, requires a long
stay, and is full of objects meriting careful study and worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of repeated examination. It is not, however, without its
drawbacks, chief among them being the not uncommon
practice in Italian towns of making air-holes from the drains
to the streets, from which unsavoury whiffs occasionally
come, not pleasant to contemplate. The authorities plainly
want in sanitary arrangements some teaching.</p>


<h3>BOLOGNA.</h3>

<p>We left Florence for Bologna by train at 7.50 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> As
we were about to enter a railway carriage, a pleasant-looking
English lady looked out and cried to us deterringly, ‘This
is not a smoking carriage.’ ‘Thank you, madam,’ I replied;
‘that is just what we want.’ So, as the two parties filled
the compartment, we were not troubled with any selfish
smoker, and, as we were all English, with no needless exclusion
of the views by lowering the blinds. We reached
Bologna at noon. The railway passes through many tunnels,
and in some places at a great elevation. The views from
it are fine.</p>

<p class="p2">Bologna is a singular old university town, very compact
within the walls, so as to accommodate its population of
109,000. From the twelve or thirteen gates in the walls,
leading streets converge to the centre, constructed with
arcades at the sides, under which the pavements and shops
are placed. The object of the arcading is probably to afford
shelter from the snow in winter and the rain in summer.
The town itself is dull, and the shops entering from the
arcades are dark and second-rate. Photographs of Bologna
can be procured at Florence, and perhaps in some as yet
undiscovered region in Bologna itself. The Hotel Brun
(the principal one) is an old-fashioned house. Like many
of the Italian hotels, the <i>salons</i> are entered direct from the
court-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as possible, as we were only to stay one night,
we went out for a drive of some hours, and were taken
first to the two leaning towers, which stand together. These
are long, lanky, and square, dark with age and long exposure
to the weather, often, I suspect, of a humid
character. One of them&mdash;the <i>Torre Asinelli</i>&mdash;said by
Bædeker to be 272, and in other authorities 320 feet
high, was originally 476 feet, or 40 feet higher than
the top of the cross of St. Peter’s. It was shortened in
1416 after an earthquake. It now lies 3 ft. 5 in. off the
perpendicular. The other, that of Garisenda, is, according
to Bædeker, 138 feet high, and upwards of 8 feet out of
the perpendicular, and by no means assuring to look at.
They are neither of them imposing architecturally,
although noted features viewed from outside the city.
From this point we went to the Etruscan Museum, in
which a variety of antiquities are exhibited, and, among
other things, several skeletons of an old date discovered in
neighbouring excavations. Under the same roof there is
also a large library, comprising upwards of 100,000
volumes. I believe the museum and library are connected
with the University, 760 years old. Close by is
the large church of San Petronio, 384 feet long by 154
feet wide, intended to have been a vast deal larger. Here
Charles v. was crowned emperor in 1530. There are various
other large churches interesting to see, but, after those
in Rome and Florence, they have, with all their grandeur,
rather a provincial look. We then drove beyond the
walls to the Villa Reale, one of the royal palaces. It
stands upon a height, and commands admirable views of
the town, out of which rise a good many towers, domes,
and spires, relieving its otherwise spiritless level. One
also sees far into the surrounding country, which, for the
most part, is very flat. The villa contains some long
corridors, one of them 500 feet long, adorned by statues.
The church of the monastery is entered from the galleries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
From this we drove (still outside the walls) to the Campo
Santo, which is much larger, is more ramified, and is older
than that at Genoa, but it is by no means equal to it either
in arrangement or in monuments. Some of the monuments
are good, but many are paltry. On our way back
to town we entered the churches of San Domenico and
San Pietro, both large, and containing greater objects of
interest than San Petronio.</p>

<p>Cab fares in Bologna are moderate. I paid the cabman
half a franc more than his fare, and, wonderful to say, he
thanked me. It was the first and only time in Italy.
The usual course is to take all that is offered and beg for
more. Do the cabmen of Bologna graduate at the
University?</p>

<p class="p2">Rain fell heavily the following morning, and as we were
to leave for Venice at twelve o’clock, we had not much
time, but I could scarcely leave Bologna without taking a
hurried glimpse of the Academia delle Belle Arti. An
hour in this large gallery was, of course, far too brief a
space for seeing its contents, and in the galleries there are
many great paintings of more or less merit; among
others, Raphael’s celebrated and beautiful picture of St.
Cecilia listening to heavenly music, in which, however
(such are the exigencies of art), six solid angels, securely
seated on a cloud, obtain their words and their time, somewhat
inconveniently, from two stout music-books, perhaps
purchased in the Via outside&mdash;a profane remark; but
irreverent thoughts will intrude even in the presence of the
most wonderful works. It was a change to pass from the
well-favoured countenance of St. Cecilia to Guido Reni’s
Crucifixion. There are indeed two Crucifixions by Guido,
but the smaller one seems to me the grander effort of
genius. The effect of the darkness in the painting is
truly sublime.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>VENICE AND VERONA.</i></p>


<h3>VENICE.</h3>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> rain continued while we proceeded to Venice, but
cleared off shortly before we arrived at our journey’s end,
about five o’clock. The country for some distance from
Bologna is very flat, and was then full of water, but rich
and verdant. We passed the towns of Ferrara, Rovigo,
and Padua. In approaching the old city Padua, the
country becomes hilly. This university town arrests
attention by its domes and towers, and seemed to invite
a visit; but one cannot see everything in a single tour.
Venice is only twenty-two miles distant from Padua, but
the railway takes nearly two hours to reach it. At last
we arrived at a broad lagune, separating the mainland
from the island city, and crossed by a railway viaduct
apparently about two miles long. From this bridge,
gazing from the carriage windows, we saw lying before
us at a little distance, like fairyland, Venice, as if floating
on the water, a strange sight! On arriving at the
station, which is real stone and lime, resting on veritable
ground, and very much like railway stations elsewhere,
except that no omnibuses or cabs wait arrival, the exit
is to the banks of the Grand Canal. We were met outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
by the <i>commissionaire</i> of the Hotel Danieli (Royal),
who gave us in charge of a boatman; and leaving the <i>commissionaire</i>
to bring the luggage afterwards, we had our
first experience&mdash;a new and curious one&mdash;of a gondola on
the canals of Venice. The boatman took us a certain
length along the Grand Canal, and then, as I found the
post office could be reached on the way, we turned aside
into a narrow canal to a place which it would have
required infinite trouble to discover, secured our letters,
and an early ingiving of our address, and thence went on
to the hotel, which is nicely situated on the Riva degli
Chiavoni,&mdash;a broad quay recently formed along the Great
Canal di San Marco from the Piazzetta at the Doge’s
Palace, eastward, I suppose, about 1000 yards, while a
continuation of the walk westward from the Piazzetta has
been made in the Royal Gardens fronting the Royal
Palace. This situation is decidedly the best in Venice.
It faces the south, and the views from it are open and
surpass others. The hotel is within a stone-throw of the
Doge’s Palace, and people can at once get out from it to
the open fresh air, walk freely about, and visit many of the
objects of greatest interest without stepping into a gondola,
or picking their way along the numerous narrow and
tortuous streets or lanes intersecting Venice, which are
extremely perplexing to a stranger. Most of the other
hotels are situated upon the canals,&mdash;sometimes in sunless
interior parts,&mdash;with communications behind by these
narrow lanes with the landward parts of the town; and
they want the advantage of the quay in front, which with
the shipping always affords a lively, interesting promenade.</p>

<p class="p2">Rain fell during the evening, but next morning we
sallied out to see a little of this wonderful place. It is a
curious sensation to see for the first time a town like Venice,
whose leading features by means of pictures have been
familiar to us from childhood; but no pictures ever come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
up to the reality. We stood for a little upon the pretty
bridge which crosses a narrow canal, and looked up to the
renowned Bridge of Sighs, which, at a considerable elevation
over this small canal, connects the east side of the
Doge’s Palace with the prison. The façade of the palace
upon this side exhibits a combination of elegance with an
appearance of massive strength, to which the lower tiers
of masonry, formed of rows of tooth-shaped or square
diamond-pointed bosses (they perhaps have a technical
name), similar to the enrichments on Crichton Castle
(Midlothian), very much contribute. Then we passed the
well-known south front of the Doge’s Palace to the Piazzetta
separating the Doge’s from the Royal Palace&mdash;a wide, open
space, wherein stand the two red granite pillars one sees
in every representation of this part of Venice; the one surmounted
by the winged lion, and the other by the former
patron of the Republic, San Teodoro, who was turned out
by the mundane authorities and succeeded in office by San
Marco, such patrons having no will of their own in the
bestowal or withdrawal of their patronage. Then walking
up by the west side of the Palace, we entered the large
open square called the Piazza di San Marco, nearly 600
feet long, by, at the east end, 270 feet wide, narrowing to
180 feet at the west end, and presenting on each side a
handsome façade in the Italian style, the lower floor being
occupied with shops and cafés under arcades. The Church
of St. Mark forms the east side of this Piazza. Near to it,
on the south-east of the Piazza, its lofty campanile rises;
while opposite the famous clock tower and clock form a
portion of the north side.</p>

<p class="p2">But the eye is first arrested by the cathedral. There is
in St. Mark’s a mixture of styles, but its predominating
Byzantine style of architecture, so different from what one
is ordinarily accustomed to,&mdash;its façade, so beautifully
ornamented by pictorial representations in mosaic, bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and vivid in their colouring; its mosque-like domes; its
pierced pinnacles; its graceful lines and cresting statues;
its numerous rich, and all differing, marble columns (500
outside and in),&mdash;give to the whole a magnificence of effect
which fixed us to the spot, gazing in admiration from beside
the noticeable and noted flagstaffs planted in front. The
pause was fatal to peace. We were immediately surrounded
by a small swarm of touters, quick to scent fresh blood,
and eager to be employed to show the way into St. Mark’s
and give imperfect or perhaps altogether unintelligible
accounts of the edifice. Brushing them aside, on entering
our first impression of the interior was of darkness and dirt.
The place is 900 years old, and the sun was at the time
under a cloud. The floor is very uneven, having sunk at
many places in a series of waves, as if it had once rested on
the Adriatic, and the traces of its motion had been left
behind. The mosaics, which cover many thousand square
feet, and are very old, are cracked, and have given way in
several parts; but it was a very curious, peculiar church,
and it grew upon one the longer it was looked at. On this
occasion we contented ourselves with a general view of the
interior, spending more than an hour in doing so, and in
seeing the ‘Presbyterio,’ which was shown by the sacristan.
The choir of the church is raised above the ground floor
of the main body, and is railed off by a parapet or screen,
adorned by eight columns and surmounted by fourteen
statues and a large central crucifix. It is reached by a
few steps, and there hangs in front of it, suspended from
the ceiling, a massive silver lamp&mdash;a peculiar adornment.
Here are the high altars with their costly ornaments, and
the principal curiosities and valuables (some of them very
ancient) of the church; among others, two pillars said to
be from Solomon’s temple. These, with the Pala d’Oro (an
elaborately-wrought gold screen), the bronze bas-reliefs, the
statues, all contribute to the interest. But other people
are waiting, and we are hurried through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time it was nearly twelve o’clock, and we went
outside to see the clock strike. The clock tower is a large
broad building six storeys high, topped by a short central
tower forming an additional storey. On the façade, a large
dial marks the hours up to twenty-four, according to old
Italian time, and some other astronomical mutations. Over
the dial there is a statue of the Virgin, and on the top of the
tower, surmounted by a golden lion, two bronze giants with
sledge-hammers strike the hours, whereupon, by means of
machinery, three puppet kings, preceded by an angel, stagger
out at a door on one side of the Virgin, and passing jerkily
along, each in turn, as it arrives opposite her, bows to her
stiffly with puppet grace, marches on, and with a twitch
disappears at another door, both doors closing after all have
done their duty. A crowd watched the performance, which
we were in luck to see, as after Whitsunday the show does
not take place for some length of time.</p>

<p class="p2">This important event witnessed, we walked round the
Piazza, which at night is a gay scene&mdash;lights blazing, a
band of music performing, and the whole square filled
with people. In the day-time it is comparatively quiet.
Here and in an adjoining street the shops of Venice
are concentrated. They are small boxes resembling
very much the little shops in the Palais Royal in Paris,
though not so rich in jewellery or so well stocked with
merchandise. In many of them there are always for sale
little models of gondolas in all kinds of material, from silver
to leather and wood. In others photographs are sold,
the photos of Venice being noted as remarkably good; and
they are printed, I think, on rather thicker paper than
elsewhere, but they are slightly dearer than those in the
South of Italy. There are also shops in which the famous
Venetian glass is sold. The manufacture of glass is a great
trade in Venice, and one sees among them very beautiful
samples of the work, embracing articles in iridescent glass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
but as the manufacturers have agents in London, it is not
very desirable to purchase such frail commodities to take
so far home. People, however, do so, and probably they
would not purchase at home; while it is certainly true
that purchases made in distant places of what is peculiar
to the place acquire a value which never attaches to the
same things procured in one’s own country. On a subsequent
day we visited one of the glass and mosaic works,
which our gondoliers (for some unaccountable reason, if we
put aside personal motives and small commissions which the
brave gondolier must assuredly be above accepting) were
always pressing we should stop at. The manufacture is
interesting, but one feels under an obligation to purchase
in requital for attention, and really the prices asked were
forbiddingly high.</p>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon of this our first day, we had our first
real experience of going about in a gondola. The gondolas
are all, by order of the authorities, to prevent expensive
rivalry in colours, painted black, and they have therefore a
very funereal look. One would think that, as it is merely
uniformity which is desired, a brighter colour might have
been chosen, and for this everybody would plead. Just fancy
all our street cabs of the colour of funeral carriages! Some
of the gondolas, perhaps all of them, have wooden removable
covers, analogous to waggonette covers, which for wet weather
may be very useful; but, generally speaking, they have, at
least in warm weather, white or light-coloured linen canopies
stretched on rods for protection from the sun, which was very
hot during our stay. These canopies, however, interfere with
the view, and as we had not the Continental dread of the
sun, we used at once to desire them to be taken down. It
is marvellous how one rower, who rows upon one side of the
boat, manages to propel it steadily along. On one occasion,
however, we had a gondolier who shook the boat from stem to
stern at every step, owing to some awkwardness he had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
managing his foot or his oar, rendering the shaking motion
most unpleasant; but with this exception (and we took
care to avoid this man again), sailing in the gondolas we
found to be one of the most delightful ways of going about,
gliding noiselessly through the water, and continually
passing others similarly engaged. The dexterity with
which the boatman steers is somewhat marvellous. He
will, for instance, approach a rope stretched from a ship, and
pass under it, the high prow clearing it by an inch. Again, on
entering the narrow canals (in doing which the men always
sing out a peculiar warning cry), or making a turn in one
of them, these long boats were managed most adroitly.
The fares for the gondolas are very moderate, being with
one gondolier 1 franc (lira) for the first hour, and half a
franc for every other. If two men be employed, the fare is
doubled. The boatmen, however, generally seem to expect
more than their fare, and even on giving more, as we always
did, we never were thanked. Whenever a gondola stops at
a place, and we had continual stoppages, there is an officious
man waiting to hook the boat with his stick, for which he
expects a soldo, value one halfpenny.</p>

<p class="p2">On occasion of our first trip we crossed the Canal di San
Marco (really an arm of the sea) to the island di San
Georgio Maggiore, on which has been built the church of
that name, which, with its dome and columned front, and its
high, conspicuous campanile, is a boldly prominent and
graceful object from the town. The main attraction inside
the church is its beautiful carved wooden choir, representing
the life of St. Benedict, executed by Alberto di Bruli, of
Flanders. It is likewise filled with marbles, bronzes, and
paintings; after examining which we ascended the campanile
and had a splendid view of Venice and of all the islands.
The view from it, indeed, is somewhat better than that
which we subsequently had from the campanile of San
Marco, which looks rather directly down upon Venice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
From this island we rowed across to another long island
called La Guidica, forming one side of the canal of the
same name; and on this island is the church of Il Redentore,
which contains some fine marbles, and in the sacristy some
paintings by Bellini.</p>

<p class="p2">But it would be almost endless to describe the various
churches which in the course of our short stay we visited.
Most of them are adorned by pictures by Titian or by
other great masters, by monumental sculptures, and by
every other species of ornamentation. I shall only mention
the names of some, with a remark.</p>

<p>The church of San Sebastian, containing the tomb of Paul
Veronese, and some of the finest specimens of that artist’s
works. Santa Maria della Salute, nearly opposite the
Royal Palace, and at the entrance to the Grand Canal&mdash;a
vast church, which with its domes forms a striking leading
feature of Venice. It was erected after the plague of 1630,
and the only wonder is that there is not an annual plague in
Venice, the smells are so atrocious. The old church of San
Stephano, with its statues, monuments, and bronzes. When
we visited it, a grand funeral service was being performed;
the singers led by a man with a baton,&mdash;very unlike real
mourning. The church of Santa Maria dei Frari, full of
monuments, paintings, and statues, but its main attractions
are the magnificent marble monuments to the memory of
Titian and Canova, in two very different styles of art. The
church of the Scalzi, or barefooted friars, gorgeously ornamented
with marbles from all parts of the world, some of
the marbles being cut in curious imitation of drapery and
cushions. The church of the Jesuits, decorated in a strange,
florid style with black and white marble&mdash;in imitation of
damask patterns, I presume, inlaid somewhat like mosaics&mdash;pillars
and pilasters and other parts being all so covered,
as if with cloth, in black and white damask. It is elaborate
and peculiar, and looks like a freak in architecture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
church of San Giovanni et Paolo, a grand old place,
full of magnificent altars, fine columns, and gorgeous
monuments, most of them to Doges, very many of whom
are buried here. This church is therefore regarded as the
Venetian Westminster Abbey. The chapel del Rosario was
an adjunct to it, and when entire must have been of exquisite
beauty, as is evident from the remains of the
sculpture. It was, unhappily, set on fire by an incendiary
in 1867, whereby many fine paintings were destroyed,
including a grand one by Titian. The keeper of the chapel
had photographs of the sculpture for sale; but, as usual
when offered at show places, asked extravagant prices.</p>

<p class="p2">The palaces, however, of Venice are among its main
attractions. They line almost continuously the Grand
Canal, and are to be found occasionally in the side canals.
Formerly the abodes of the old nobility, probably few of
them are now occupied by private proprietors. To appearance,
the majority of them are diverted to other uses&mdash;some
as government offices, others as hotels, others as museums,
and, I suspect, even in some cases for purposes of trade and
manufacture. For any one to attempt to describe them in
few pages would be vain, and they require the aid of the
pictorial art to realize them. Fortunately, good photographs
of many of them can be procured. They are imposing, and
not infrequently very beautiful buildings. Their design
is in some cases a species of fanciful Gothic, and in others
the heavier style of the Renaissance; but a character of
their own pervades them, denoting them Venetian. Our
architects at home occasionally reproduce them in our
public buildings, with variations. No two are alike. Their
variety is pleasing, and age has in many imparted a rich
colouring to the stone or marble of which they are built.
In nearly all the balcony is a prominent feature; and
no doubt on many grand occasions their balconies were
crowded by the fairest of the fair, decked in their best attire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and many bright and loving eyes have peered over balustrades
gaily decorated with brilliant hangings on sumptuous
pageants passing beneath, and darted captivating glances on
favoured gallants taking their part in the spectacles. Long
poles stuck into the canal in front of many of the palaces
indicate the nobility of the families to which they now or
at one time belonged. Some of the rooms in these palaces
are very spacious, as, for example, those in the Palazzo
Pesaro, a large edifice in the style of the Renaissance,
where there was one great hall the whole depth of the
house, from the front facing the canal to the back. This
room was filled with pictures, some for sale; and, as usual,
balconies overlooked the canal, from which we had a
charming view of all the life afloat. In the Palazzo Emo-Treves
we were shown the two last works of Canova&mdash;statues
of Hector and Ajax. They are gigantic, and seem
rather out of place in a comparatively small room. In
other palaces the visitors are conducted through suites of
rooms hung with paintings.</p>

<p class="p2">So numerous are the palaces, that I see eighty-nine are
mentioned in a small but useful guide-book, called <i>A Week
in Venice</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the churches being about as many in number.
The grand palace of all, however, is the Doge’s. This is a
magnificent building both inside and out. The admission
is by ticket, costing a franc each for the palace itself, with
extra tickets for the Bridge of Sighs and the Museum, a
small collection. The palace is a square or oblong building,
with a large court-yard in the centre, and both externally
and on the walls of the court is highly decorated; but there
is a heaviness in the upper part of the west and south
exterior façades, and a dumpiness about the windows with
which these parts are pierced, which could never reconcile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
me to them. Even the lower part in its arcading wants
relief. Thirty-four Gothic arches in a row, and all monotonously
alike in size and figure, however beautiful
individually, without a break loses in effect. The entrance
from the Piazzetta is by a beautiful Gothic doorway closely
adjoining St. Mark’s, richly sculptured. After examining
and passing through it, we find ourselves at the foot of the
Giant’s Staircase; but the large central square court round
which the palace extends arrests the eye, and we enter it
to admire the interior façades, particularly those on the
east and north. The north side is short and broken, and
more diversified than the others, not merely by statues and
a peculiar rich ornamentation, but by the domes of St. Mark,
which tower over it and claim to be a portion of the structure.
But after lingering about this handsome court, and
taking a look at the carved bronze wells which are placed
in it, and from which water is obtained, ascent is made by
the Giant’s Staircase to the first floor, where admission is
gained to the portions of the building shown to the public.
The arrangement of the rooms is somewhat perplexing to
the visitor, requiring a plan which is not anywhere given to
guide him through. But we find our way through some
immense halls, all decorated by huge pictures principally
representing scenes in the history of Venice&mdash;real ‘gallery
pictures’ in point of extent of canvas, but highly suitable
to the noble proportions of the rooms. One picture, not
by any means a pleasing one, is the largest in the world,
and occupies the whole breadth of an immense room&mdash;’Paradise,’
by Tintoretto, who seemed fond of enormous
canvases; his chef-d’&oelig;uvre, the Crucifixion, in the
Scola di S. Rocco, being also huge. The ceilings of the
rooms in the palace, some of them lofty, are also, according
to Italian practice, embellished with paintings and massive
gilding; but labour and expense seem greatly thrown away,
it is such a strain to look up to them. In one large room,
just below the ceiling, in a running row, portraits are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
seen of all the Doges, 120 in number, commencing in
the year 697 and ending 1797, a period of exactly 1100
years. One of them, however, as a traitor to Venice, is
painted under veil. These portraits in all likelihood
are, at least among the earlier Doges, as reliable as are
those of the early kings of Scotland in the gallery of Holyrood
Palace, or of those of the earlier popes in certain
churches in Rome. The rooms, however, of greatest interest
are those in which the Doge and his council assembled in
conclave; and one cannot help, when in such rooms, endeavouring
to conjure up old scenes happening there, and
thinking how the glory of Venice has departed.</p>

<p>When in the library we were asked to go into a small
room off it, where we were shown some old MSS., and a
fine old unique breviary, with most beautiful illuminated
illustrations. It has been or is being photographed, and
I presume copies will be for sale.</p>

<p>The dungeons, which are seen by crossing the Bridge
of Sighs, are, so far as shown, small, but sufficiently repellent.</p>

<p class="p2">The Doge’s Palace abuts upon the church of St. Mark,
which we rarely passed without entering. On Whitsunday
(20th May 1877) a grand service was held in the church.
The singing was performed by about from twelve to twenty
choristers in the organ gallery, with a leader. The voices
were splendid, and the music very fine. On another occasion
we walked round the gallery of the church under
guidance of an attendant, and examined the mosaics, of
which one thus gets a nearer view. They are imposing,
but unfortunately are giving way in many places. At a
west window we were taken outside to see the four fine
bronze horses over the portal, which form a feature in the
ornamentation of the façade. The horses are, however, in
size small, and apparently not sufficiently gigantic for the
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Piazza di San Marco immense flocks of pigeons
are always to be seen; they are kept under the protection
of the city, the law being that to kill or ill-treat them is a
punishable offence. Every day at two o’clock they are
regularly fed with grain, and they are said to know the
time so exactly as to arrive for their dinner from all quarters
at the precise hour. It is certainly remarkable to see
how tame they are, being quite devoid of the fear and dread
of man, perching all over any stranger who will feed them,
with as much confidence as if they were with Adam or Eve
in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p class="p2">After we had seen a good deal of Venice we ascended
the campanile of St. Mark. This is a wide square tower,
and by a commodious sloping internal ascent the belfry is
attained, where we get among the bells. The hours are
struck by a man stationed to pull the ropes and watch for
fires, which, when he discovers, he notifies to the proper
quarter&mdash;a useful, but, I fear, a rare species of precaution
against this species of calamity. The view from this tower
(which is 322 feet high to the hair of the angel’s head, an
altitude which I need scarcely say we did not attempt) is
commanding, ranging over the city and lagunes, looking,
however, as I have already said, a little too directly down
upon the roofs of the houses below. However, one gets a
pretty clear idea of the map of Venice, with its multifarious
canals, islands, and narrow streets. As stated by Bædeker,
the ‘15,000 houses and palaces of Venice (population,
128,901) are situated on 3 large and 114 small islands,
formed by 147 canals, connected by 378 bridges (most of
them stone), and altogether about 7 miles in circumference.’
I occasionally endeavoured to thread my way through the
narrow streets of Venice, and considered it rather an
achievement the first time I managed to pioneer through all
the intricacies of the passage from the Piazza San Marco to
the Ponte Rialto and back again. This famous bridge is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
a graceful marble arch, of one span of 74 feet, across the
Grand Canal. An elegant marble balustrade protects each
side, the space on the bridge being divided into three footways
by two covered arched or arcaded buildings used as
shabby little shops, which one would gladly see abolished,
being so little in keeping with the handsome character of
the bridge. Here at the Rialto there are also markets on
either side of the canal, for the sale of fruit and other
things.</p>

<p class="p2">Situated on the Grand Canal, but nearer to the railway
station, is the Museo Correr, in which we found a collection
of pictures, armour, and curiosities, of no great extent, but
said to be valuable. The Palazzo Marcello (proprietor,
Richetti) contains a quantity of ‘antiquities,’ curiosities,
bronzes, and other things manufactured for sale, some of
them curiously designed.</p>

<p class="p2">Nearer to the principal part of the town the Academia
delle Belle Arti lies&mdash;a very extensive collection of paintings
in twenty large halls, besides smaller rooms, the pictures
numbering in all 679. These are all, with the exception of
a few of the Dutch school, if I am not mistaken, the works
of Italian artists, most of them by the great masters, and
many on a large scale. Among others is what is considered
Titian’s masterpiece&mdash;’The Assumption of the Virgin,’ a
clear and brilliant, a glorious work in point of drawing
and colour. In fact, the colour is perhaps rather too strong
in reds and blues. One great canvas, a grand picture by
Paul Veronese of the banquet in Levi’s house, occupies the
entire breadth of the largest hall. The banquet is represented
as held under a remarkably Venetian-looking light
colonnade, open to the outer air, and peopled by characters
evidently clothed in Venetian attire of the painter’s era.
But it scarcely does to scan such works of art with too
much regard to accessories. What appears to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
favourite picture is another Veronese&mdash;a Virgin with a
young, naked, little St. John the Baptist standing on a
pedestal, with legs to appearance (it may be merely the
effect of shade) of unequal lengths. There were half a
dozen painters when we were there, engaged in copying the
chubby St. John. Copies of it may be seen in many of
the shops of Venice. They are, I fancy, favourites with
the ladies. We paid only one visit to the Academy, but it
would take several visits to do its galleries justice.</p>

<p class="p2">The arsenal of Venice, dating back to the year 1104, is
well worthy of a visit for the sake of its museum, an
interesting collection of arms and models of ships, particularly
of the grand state gondolas; nothing but the museum
is apparently shown to the ordinary visitor. The arsenal
is not so extensive as it once was. Admission is had by
simply entering one’s name in the visitors’ book, and, as
usual at all these show places where admission is not by
payment, giving a small fee to the <i>custodes</i>, one being
stationed in each hall.</p>

<p class="p2">A steamboat, large enough for the traffic, sailed every
hour from the quay in front of our hotel to the island of
Lido, about two miles distant. We crossed in it one afternoon;
and the sail is interesting, as the vessel passes the
other islands, and fine views are had from it of the town,
and, in the distance, of the mountains of the Tyrol. The
island of Lido is long and narrow. Upon landing we
walked across to the other side, about half a mile of road.
Here we were on the borders of the Adriatic. The island
is a bright little spot with a few buildings on it. Returning,
we got on board just in time to escape, under cover of
its awning, a thunder-shower which came pelting down
very heavily, and lasted all the time we were on board.</p>

<p class="p2">We had now been eight days in Venice, and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
constantly going about seeing much that was to be seen,
but yet only seeing it in a superficial way. There was no
place in Italy which was more attractive. Its gorgeous
palaces and churches, its strange, unique kind of life, the
multitudinous canals teeming with gondolas, and the
pleasure of moving about in them, was something we
never could forget. We saw Venice usually in brilliant
sunshine, with everything sparkling in light, although
nearly every afternoon, with a severe punctuality which
enabled us generally to be prepared for it, black clouds
gathered, and a thunderstorm emptied them quickly. But
perhaps the most beautiful sight of all was to see Venice
in moonlight. One is familiar with photographs of the
fair city, tinted with a deep blue in imitation of moonlight
effect, a white spot being picked out for the moon herself
(as, of course, the photographs are taken during the day),
and I can hardly say that there is in these pictures much,
if any, exaggeration. The blueness of the sky, and of
everything with which the light is tinged in moonlight, is
something remarkable and very lovely, while the effect is
increased when the moon, getting behind a cloud, gives to
the cloud a luminous edging of silver.</p>

<p class="p2">We were exceedingly unwilling to leave this bright
fairyland, but became afraid to stay longer. The fact is,
that with all its attractiveness Venice has not, at least to
a stranger, the feeling of healthiness. It drains into the
canals, where the tide rises and falls only 2 feet, and
has not force sufficient to carry off the drainage. The
effluvium from the narrow canals is sometimes overpowering,
and yet it is said, as it is said of so many other places
one might imagine insalubrious, that Venice is naturally so
healthy that the people are notedly long-lived; and, indeed,
one instance of this occurs in the case of Titian, who lived
to the patriarchal age of ninety-nine. How this comes,
‘let doctors tell.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>We left on 23d May, pursuing our way up the Grand
Canal and under the Ponte Rialto, and on to the railway
station,&mdash;a long pull, but one we always enjoyed. In fact,
if a visitor do nothing but obtain a sail along this canal, he
sees the greater part of Venice; just as, though much less
completely, a stranger sees much of London by a sail upon
the Thames, and would see more were the main buildings,
as at Venice, placed upon its banks; which henceforth,
perhaps, there is a hope they may be. The canal is, I
think, about two miles in length, and on an average
not less than 100 feet wide, and is lined by palaces,
churches, and houses, in the utmost irregularity of height
and diversity of character and style, many of them beautiful,
while the canal itself is alive with gondolas; and the
<i>tout ensemble</i> is so picturesque, that when the sun shines,
as it generally did, everything looks engaging to the
eye. One by one we passed and gazed at the palaces
(which had become, as it were, old friends) with many a
lingering look, as if resolved we never should forget them.
But the vision came to an end as we entered the modern
and disenchanting railway station, whence we shortly after
proceeded on our journey to Verona, the scene of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>. Romance was not, therefore, to be quite at
an end, and as the train issued out of the railway station
the curtain was raised for a momentary glimpse; and slowly
wending our way over the lagune by the long viaduct of
222 arches, we looked intently on the floating city,
wondering if ever we should see it again. Losing sight of
it lying on the one side, attention was forthwith drawn to
the other by the line of the Tyrolese mountains, which at
some distance were in view, and flanking us nearly the
whole way. We passed Padua and Vicenza, and through
a country which is flat, but was smiling in the greens of
early summer, and after a journey of about seventy miles
in four hours reached our destination.</p>

<h3>VERONA.</h3>

<p>We had proposed spending two nights at Verona, but
American friends who came with us from Venice were
anxious to get on to Milan, so that we had just two hours
the following morning for a drive about the town. We
regretted afterwards that our opportunity was not greater,
for it is indeed a place at which one may stay for a few
days with advantage. It is very picturesquely situated on
the river Adige, and contains a good deal that is interesting.
We first drove through the old market-place, where people
were busy selling fruit, vegetables, and other things in a
piazza surrounded by curious old houses. Then into the
Piazza dei Signori, where are some very fine buildings, old
and new, and adjoining it a small open space or square
closely surrounded by houses, in which the noted and
highly decorated tombs of the Scaligers, enclosed within a
wall and railing, are seen. Then on to the Arena, which is
not so imposing as the Colosseum or even the Arena at
Nismes, and although covering more ground than the
latter, was seated for fewer spectators; but it is in a very
perfect condition&mdash;the most perfect, I think, of any we
saw in Italy, the large marble slabs of which it is built
being nearly all in place. We mounted to the top
row, and had an excellent view of the country round
about. From this we drove to the church of San Zenone
Maggiore, a thousand years old, and very curious. The
portal is peculiar, and adorned by rich marble reliefs.
Within are some fine old pillars, said to be of single pieces
of marble, a crypt, and cloisters&mdash;altogether a place of
great interest and of striking conformation. We were only
sorry we had so little time to examine it minutely, for we
could take but a rapid walk round. Returning to town we
entered two other churches,&mdash;San Fermo Maggiore, with an
open ceiling in walnut wood, and the Duomo, which is
quaintly ornamented; but we had seen so many Italian
churches elsewhere that we were rather attracted to a little
building at the end of a garden, said to be the tomb of
Juliet. One is fain to believe in it, but as matter of fact
it is discredited. This tomb so-called Juliet’s is an elegant,
small, open, three-arched vault, or recessed covered place with
slender double columns, containing within a sarcophagus.
More certainty is attached to what is shown at a different
part of the town as Juliet’s window; but, alas for the
romance! the window looks into the street, and it has no
balcony.</p>

<p>So rapid a survey was not doing justice to fair Verona.
There was much more to be seen in the town, while the
river and its bridges and surroundings, and the neighbouring
country, all looked so picturesque and inviting, that I have
no doubt it is a favourite halting-place for the artist, and
it may well repay a visit of some days.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>MILAN AND THE ITALIAN LAKES.</i></p>

<h3>MILAN.</h3>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> left Verona at mid-day for Milan. The scenery was
fine, and for some miles we had Lake Garda, the largest of
the Italian lakes, in view, at one part as near as only a mile
off. Here we passed over the field of the battle of Solferino,
which took place on 24th June 1859. An interest
naturally attaches to ground where not many years previously
a great battle was fought, and so many events
were being enacted terrible to the actors, but there
is nothing specially to mark it out. The day had been
clear when we started, but before we got to Milan the
clouds began to gather, the sky became very black, and we
unluckily arrived at four o’clock in a thunderstorm. However,
we had not far to drive down the wide Corso to the
Hôtel de Ville, which is well situated near the Cathedral,
in the principal street of Milan.</p>

<p class="p2">We were out betimes next morning to see the glorious
cathedral. It is certainly a magnificent church, inside
and out, built of white marble, and of great size and
height, being only inferior in size or extent to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Peter’s.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was not a little refreshing to see a Gothic church
of any sort, after having had so much elsewhere in other
styles. It is not divided into or surrounded by chapels,
so that it wants the aid which these accessories afford for
decoration; and therefore, in contrast with many less pretentious
churches, there is a feeling of vacancy about it,
although it is devoid of the gloom of the large, empty,
dark Duomo of Florence. Fault, no doubt, has been found
with the windows that they do not throw down the light
sufficiently from above, but the windows themselves are
traceried and filled with beautiful stained glass. Upon
entering by the great portal at the west, the eye is caught
in the far distance by the glimmering colours of the grand
east window, whose dimensions are colossal, as may be
gathered from the fact that its traceried compartments
comprise no fewer than 350 pictures in glass, copies, in
many instances, of known paintings. Then the eye is
arrested by four long rows of lofty clustered columns&mdash;upwards
of 50 in number in all&mdash;each 8 feet in diameter
and 90 feet high, their comparative slenderness giving an
airy character to the great interior, which rises in graceful
pointed arches in the nave to the height of 152 feet. These
pillars are most peculiarly adorned by a sort of double
capital, between which are placed in canopied niches sculptured
figures or statues in white marble, evincing that
herein Milan is master; but somehow they do not attain
the effect of a grand capital. The roof is painted in imitation
fretwork or open carving, a species of deception which,
however well done, is hardly to be expected, or even
tolerated, where no cost has otherwise been spared.</p>

<p>The exterior has so light and fairy-like an appearance
that one can hardly believe it to be of stone, and yet all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the parts which look so light and delicate are in reality
massive and substantial marble. The mass or quantity of
statues is really surprising. Niches innumerable contain
them, studded at every conceivable spot over the huge
building. Every one of the countless pinnacles, besides
being adorned in successive courses by them, is surmounted
by a statue, a mute mast-headed man, patiently and uncomplainingly
remaining where he has been ordered to do duty,
and so aiding to adorn the magnificent edifice. The number
of marble statues inside and outside has been variously
computed, but cannot be less than 4000. The central
tower may be objected to as fully too small or too light for
the size of the building, but it is in style in harmony with
the numberless spirelets which rise like a forest around it,
sometimes in clusters, and spanned by flying buttresses in
lace-like decoration, which give strength and stability to a
structure which, if it were not irreverent to say so, has a
good deal of the look, in its white purity, of a most gigantic
and beautiful bride-cake.</p>

<p>We lingered about the cathedral on our first visit for a
long time. It was grand to hear the great organ pealing
through the vast chamber, although the music was not so
fine as it had been at St. Mark’s on the Sunday.</p>

<p class="p2">The following morning (for while at Milan we never
missed seeing it every day) we again entered the church,
and found an important service proceeding, apparently
either a levée, or, more likely, a consecration of priests.
An old bishop wearing a large mitre sat on his throne, and
one after another young men ascended and knelt before
him, when he placed his paternal hands on the head of
each successively, and apparently kissed him. The string
of those who thus went up for consecration seemed, like
Paddy’s rope, to have had the other end cut off&mdash;we thought
it would never terminate. But what struck me much was
the remarkable want of intelligence in the faces of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
priests, particularly those who wore the grandest dresses;
they had such a stupid, stolid look, reminding one very
much of a ‘donnered auld Hieland porter.’ After witnessing
enough of this ceremony, we ascended the stair leading
to the summit, admission to which costs a small fee.
The cathedral is 360 feet high, if not higher to the topmost
point, for here also authorities differ; but the point
I reached might not exceed 300 feet, and, if I am not
mistaken, there did not seem to be open access to the
public to a higher elevation. There are many breaks of
the ascent by the way, where one can halt and look around
and have a near view of the sculpture, which is by no
means coarsely executed; the figures, however, upon the
top of these long needle-shaped pinnacles convey a nervous
dread of their stability, though, no doubt, securely fastened.
About many of them lightning conductors are placed,
without which they might only be points of attraction for the
electric fluid. The roof of the building is composed of slabs
of white marble in neat layers or courses overlapping each
other upon a slope of moderate angle, giving a remarkably
clean finish to the whole. It was glorious to think of this
being a work of man. One could envy the feelings of the
architect who had the honour to design and commence it,
but did not live to see it completed. It was begun in
1385; the main body was finished thirty-three years later,
but the central spire not till the year 1440. It may be
said, therefore, that it is 450 years old, and yet it has
such a freshness about it that one could readily suppose
it is hardly a generation old. They are, however, always
making additions to and repairing it. Standing upon the
high tower, and surrounded by a forest of marble pinnacles
and statues, and by rich sculpture at every point, the eye
is yet attracted to the distant view from the summit, which
is very magnificent. The country, which for miles from
Milan is very flat but verdant, lies spread out in panorama,
from Turin, 80 miles distant, to Venice, 150 miles off;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
but Venice, at least, is too distant to be visible, and I doubt
if Turin, even by aid of a glass, can be descried. Right in
front to the north, and thence west and east, within a
radius of from 80 to 100 miles, the grand mountain ranges
of Switzerland lie. We saw some of the snowy peaks, but
unfortunately the sky was clouded, and the view of most
of them was obscured. But we took note of where Mont
Blanc, the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa, and other old friends
might have been seen on a clear day, though it would
require a good telescope to distinguish the different mountain
celebrities. The Italian lakes are, with the exception
of Lake Garda, between 30 and 40 miles distant, but, shut
in by the mountains, they are not visible, although we
imagined we could make out their situation. The city of
Milan lay compactly spread out all around just under us,
the cathedral standing very much in the centre of all.</p>

<p class="p2">We were fortunate in getting a tolerably clear day for
this ascent. I had intended to go up again on the following
Monday, but found it too cloudy to be of any use.
Another rather interesting sight, however, was in progress
that day within the church; for an immense number of young
children&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;were all seated in long rows
round a vacant space, wherein were priests with candles,
and an archbishop or some other dignitary, who was going
round them. The girls were all dressed in white with
white veils, the boys in their best attire, many of them with
white ties and some with white waistcoats. The children
seemed to be from seven to fifteen years of age, and by all
it was evidently regarded as a grand gala-day&mdash;something
like a public school examination-day in Scotland, before
breaking up for the summer holidays. They were perhaps
receiving confirmation. The procession of priests
stopped at each child in rotation. The old bishop performed
motions with his hands over each&mdash;I suppose making the
form of the cross over them, and mumbling something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
inaudibly. It must have taken a long time so to go over
them all, as there were several hundreds.</p>

<p class="p2">The people of Milan have wisely left a large vacant
space or piazza in front of the cathedral, upon its west side,
so that one can admire, without intervening interruption, its
beauty from a sufficient distance. On the south side of the
piazza, or rather of the cathedral, the Royal Palace, a plain
building, is situated. The piazza itself is surrounded on
three sides by new and very handsome commercial buildings,
which are quite an ornament to the place; and out of
it, upon the north side, there has been built, at an expense
of no less than £320,000, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele&mdash;a
splendid arcade, or rather street or streets of stone buildings,
laid out in the shape of a cross, covered over by
an iron and glass vaulted roof, upon the Crystal Palace
model. The main gallery is nearly 1000 feet long, about
50 feet wide, and 94 feet high; and it is occupied in the
lower floor by shops, and the upper floors apparently by
warehouses or other places of business, the façades being
of an elegant style adorned by sculpture. The central
dome is particularly graceful, and at night is lighted up by
a circle of gas jets placed round the top. These, with the
other lights, produce a most brilliant effect, and it is scarcely
surprising to find that in the evening the gallery is crowded
by the townspeople and strangers, so that passage through
it is rather difficult. This gallery&mdash;really the most perfect
thing of the kind I have seen anywhere&mdash;leads out
at the other end to another piazza, in the centre of which
a very fine marble monument to Leonardo da Vinci has
been erected. He stands surrounded by four of his pupils,
all of white marble. In another part of the town is the
famous picture by that artist of the Last Supper, a fresco
which is almost obliterated. The charge for admission to
see this celebrated work is at the exorbitant rate of 1
franc per person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>There may be seen gratuitously on the streets of Milan
a picture of a different kind in the elaborately made-up
head-dress of the women. In a pad of hair at the back of
the head a dozen or two of long pins, of more or less
magnificence, are stuck, in arrangements to suit the fancy
of the wearer, but most commonly in a fan shape. It is
not for man to pry into the hidden mysteries of the toilet,
but it seems scarcely possible for any woman to effect this
elaborate tire unaided, nor is it probable that the effect is
achieved by a daily effort. The amount of nightly torture
by acupressure to which the Milanese women may therefore
subject themselves, in obedience to a law of fashion,
is not agreeable to contemplate. We can only be grateful.</p>

<p class="p2">In order to see a little of the town, we took a carriage
one afternoon and drove out in the direction of the Piazza
d’Armi, a large open space about 2000 feet square, outside
the inhabited part of the city. The castle or barracks occupies
one side of the square. The noble Arco della Pace,
begun by Napoleon in 1804 as a termination to the Simplon
route, faces the castle on the west side. It is of the same
character as the triumphal arches of the Tuileries at Paris,
and the Piazza Cavour at Florence, and is a beautiful three-arched
gateway of white marble, Corinthian columns supporting
an entablature, on the top of which a hero drives six fiery
horses abreast, in utmost peril to himself and them (were
they living), while a man on horseback at each of the four
top corners, in equal peril and in violent action, holds up a
conqueror’s wreath. These figures, being in bronze, will not,
it is supposed, readily commit an act of self-destruction.</p>

<p>On the north side of the piazza there is a large, modern,
oval amphitheatre of wood, and without cover, within which
races are held, and capable of accommodating 30,000
spectators.</p>

<p>From the piazza we proceeded to visit some of the
churches, and <i>inter alia</i> the church of San Ambrogio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
founded by Saint Ambrose in the fourth century. It is
entered by passing through a large arcaded court or <i>atrium</i>
in front, dating back a thousand years. The church,
associated with various events in history, is ancient evidently,
and peculiar in its interesting decoration, but not
to be compared with that of San Zeno in Verona. On
Sundays mass is celebrated, accompanied by the old
Ambrogian music, but this we did not hear. The church
of San Lorenzo was not far off&mdash;also a very ancient building,
said, in part at least, to have been built in the fourth
century. It is octagonal in form and surmounted by a
dome. A colonnade of sixteen large Corinthian columns
stands close by, and is thought to have formed part of a
Roman building or temple, of which the church may at first
have been also a part. All the churches, at the time of our
visit, were being decorated for Trinity Sunday.</p>

<p class="p2">The picture gallery (the Pinacoteca) was unfortunately
closed while we were in Milan, so that we missed seeing
its frescoes and examples of the great masters. There is
apparently not much more to be seen in Milan than what
I have mentioned; but it contains some good streets and a
public park&mdash;not of great extent&mdash;embracing within it in a
zoological garden a small and not very valuable collection
of animals. This park is no doubt a very nice retreat in
hot weather. We spent an hour in it one afternoon, and
while there witnessed a very novel method of watering the
road. Attached to a water-barrel drawn on a cart, was a
flexible pipe about five or six feet long and about six inches
in diameter, with a bulb at the end perforated with holes.
A man walked behind with a rope attached to the bulb, by
which he jerked it about so as to spread the water from
side to side all across the road. This man, who was endowed
with a pair of five-o’clock legs, was, notwithstanding
his deformity,&mdash;which seemed, indeed, to contribute to his
power of dispersing the water,&mdash;somewhat of a wag, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
a wicked leer quietly contrived to bestow an amicable
sprinkling on the laughing nurserymaids as he passed.
The method of watering, however, was both novel and
ingenious, and answered its purpose remarkably well. But
there was little dust to lay in this rainy quarter; and
indeed it never was, while we were in Milan, particularly
hot, and perhaps it never is; while in winter-time, especially
in December, it is sometimes a place of excessive cold.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3>ITALIAN LAKES.</h3>

<p>We left Milan for Baveno on Monday, 28th May, at
noon. It was a slow train to Arona, where passengers
embark on board the steamer on Lago Maggiore. Unfortunately,
just before arrival at Arona, the rain began to fall
heavily, so that we not only had to walk on board in the
rain, but we did not see the lake to advantage. For
although the rain shortly ceased, the clouds remained and
no sunshine succeeded, and a haze hung over the lake,
which then assumed very much the appearance of one of
our Highland lochs in similar condition, except for the
Italian character and bright colouring of the houses on the
margin. On a sunny day the lake would, no doubt, wear
a different aspect. Fortunately it continued fair till we
got housed in the large, comfortable Hotel Belle Vue at
Baveno, which, lying at the point of a jutting promontory
upon the border of the lake, looks out right upon it. Soon
afterwards, however, the rain again began, and it fell in
torrents, to our great disappointment, and continued almost
without intermission till the Friday afternoon, when it
cleared up, and in the evening of that day we had a
beautiful sunset, with the sun shining brightly upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Simplon, to see which effect all the people in the hotel
turned out upon a balcony commanding it. In consequence
of the clouds we hardly ever could see across the lake,
so much so that I could only finish on the Friday evening
a sketch of it which I began on the Monday afternoon upon
arrival, the mountains being invisible or under a gloomy
pall nearly the whole intervening time. When we could
catch the view it was very beautiful. The lake is here just
sufficiently broad to form a fine picture, the bold, well-marked,
conical mountains on the other or east side,&mdash;one of
the peaks, I believe, rising to about 6000 feet,&mdash;the neighbouring
town of Pallanza on the north, and the mountains
behind it composing the background to the lake, studded
by the charming Borromean Islands, lying so picturesquely
near, with their curious houses and their trees; Isola Bella,
with its strange gardens, being an especial feature. These
islands are the great attraction to Baveno; but unfortunately
we had not the opportunity of seeing them, except
from the steamboat in passing, as the days were never fair
sufficiently long to permit of our venturing in a boat to
land upon them. If there be anything else to see in the
neighbourhood of Baveno, as doubtless there was, we had
little means of becoming acquainted with it, for usually
upon venturing out for a walk we were speedily driven back
again by warning drops. The town itself is a mere village,
although the houses are capacious&mdash;bulky, barrack-looking&mdash;and
the church on the slope above is large, with a high,
square, ugly campanile. Luckily, the windows of our rooms,
as well as of the public rooms, all looked over the lake; and
there was a library of books for visitors’ use, which, in this
unpropitious condition of the atmosphere, received marked
attention from all; but it was the dreariest time we had
spent since we left home, reminding us rather too much of
Loch Lomond in its normal condition.</p>

<p class="p2">When the Saturday morning came with bright sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
we were glad to avail ourselves of it, lest we might become
prisoners for another week, and to be off accordingly for
Lugano, which is situated on a portion of outlying Swiss
territory overlapping Italy, so that one has to cross an odd
nook of Switzerland to get from Maggiore to Lake Como.
The trip in the steamboat is pleasant, and in crossing from
Baveno to Pallanza, which is probably about three miles
distant by water, we had the good fortune to see both the
Simplon and Monte Rosa through a gap in the mountains&mdash;the
latter raising its snowy head in the distance.
Pallanza is a place which some people prefer to Baveno for
stopping at in order to see Lago Maggiore. It is much
more of a town, and, commanding the view of Monte Rosa,
has a finer outlook, while it is not very much farther
from Isola Bella and the other islands, a pull to which must
be most enjoyable. From Pallanza the steamer crossed to
the other side of the lake, then went up to Luino, where we
disembarked, and on our leaving it proceeded to the northern
extremity with those <i>en route</i> for the St. Gothard Pass. It
was a glorious sail in the bright sunshine, with Monte Rosa,
the Simplon, and also, in the upper portion, St. Gothard,
all appearing snow-clad in view. The porter of the hotel
had asked us to allow him to telegraph for a carriage to
be waiting us at Luino, and willing to oblige him we consented,
but we should have been better to have chosen one
for ourselves upon arrival. However, it was a lovely drive
of above two hours and a half to Lugano, part of the way
being by the banks of a river, which was greatly swollen by
the five days’ previous rain. The Hotel du Parc at Lugano
is nicely situated near the lake at the entrance to the town,
and has a small garden attached to it. It was formerly a
monastery, and is built as a large square house, with a courtyard
in the middle. Bædeker recommends Lugano as a very
pleasant place for a lengthened stay; and it may be so, but
we were anxious to get on to Lake Como to rest there, and
remained only three nights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Hot sunny weather succeeded the week of rain, so that we
enjoyed walks by the banks of the gleaming lake, plucking
the wild-flowers, which were abundant, though not of many
kinds. The town of Lugano looks very well in the distance&mdash;a
mile off&mdash;at the head or north end of the lake, but it
is not particularly enticing in itself, and it lies too much
on the level of the water, so that the road was, when we
arrived, half covered, the lake having, in consequence of the
continued rain, overflowed its banks. The Lake of Lugano
looks bold, and in a storm would look angry, from the fact
that except at the north end the mountains appear to dip
almost sheer down upon it. I believe the sail from the
other end to Lugano (which is what those who purchase
circular tickets from Milan obtain a coupon for) is very
grand, but a gentleman I subsequently met told me he had
experienced a terrific storm upon it, in which the vessel
was in the greatest danger, as the sailors could not see
where they were being driven to, by reason of a dense fog.</p>

<p>Upon the Monday we walked in a broiling sun, from
which we could not always obtain shelter, about two miles
up the road leading to the top of San Salvatore, which, 3000
feet high, is the great ascent here, and to those in good
health and active, the exercise is rewarded by an extensive
prospect, while a hotel offers refreshment on the summit.
Choosing shady places where to rest, we spent a charming
day upon this road, which everywhere commanded fine
views, particularly down upon the lake and up to the
snowy mountains of the St. Gothard range.</p>

<p>In the old church adjoining the hotel there are three
frescoes by Luini, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci. The
principal fresco, that of the Crucifixion, is a curious large
picture, containing within it, expressively depicted and
cleverly arranged, all the different scenes connected with
the death of our Saviour, from His trial to His ascension.
But the three crosses are lengthened to what represents
20 feet at least, in order to admit of use being made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
background. Many angels are ministering to our Lord,
while one angel is on the cross of the repentant thief, and
a devil crawling along the other cross has charge of his
sinful fellow. A skull and cross-bones at the foot of the
central cross indicate the place to be Golgotha. The
picture is quite a study.</p>

<p class="p2">We left Lugano for Bellaggio on the Monday morning by
steamer for Porlezza, at the east end of the lake, about ten
miles distant. Before reaching it we crossed the invisible
line which here separates Italy from Switzerland, and the
steamer was boarded by an Italian custom-house officer.
Upon arrival at Porlezza our luggage underwent the formality
of examination, and we the reality of detention for
a considerable time until the examination was concluded.
From this town to Menaggio, on Lake Como, the drive was
in an omnibus, and we regretted much afterwards not
having had a carriage to ourselves, as we could see little
from the omnibus windows. The distance is about six or
seven miles, and inclines gradually to the shoulder of a
hill overlooking Lake Como; and in such a bright, sunny
day as we were favoured with, the drive in an open carriage
would have been delightful, especially on approaching Lake
Como from the high ground, where it is seen lying magnificently
below. One advantage of a private carriage is that
it may be stopped at the will of the party, and the scene
viewed at leisure. Coach and omnibus fares here were quite
after Highland rates. At Menaggio, finding the steamboat
would not arrive for an hour and a half, we took a boat
(charge, 3 fr.), and were in three-quarters of an hour rowed
across the lake to the Hotel Grand Bretagne, which is
nicely situated away to the south end of Bellaggio, and
outside the small town. It was hot, broiling sunshine, and
this, our first experience of a boat upon Como, was exceedingly
charming. Blinds were all down, and nobody observed
our arrival, so our boatman had to shout from the quay
across the garden to the hotel porter. We found very
comfortable quarters in this hotel, which is a large, long
building, with many bedrooms looking to the lake; for, if
I am not mistaken, there were upwards of 100 bedroom
windows overlooking it. The ground floor is entirely
occupied by a suite of public rooms, terminating at one end
in a large, airy dining-hall, and on the other in a superb,
similarly large drawing-room, both with suitably lofty ceilings.
Other public rooms on this floor are occupied as <i>salles
à manger</i> and <i>salons de conversation</i>, <i>de concert et de lecture</i>, <i>de
billiard</i>, etc. In one of the reading-rooms there was a small
library for the use of the visitors. I do not think we had
found anywhere such ample public accommodation within
doors, while in front a large garden extended the whole
length of the house, reaching up into grounds and a wood
behind, with shady seats under the trees, where one could
sit and read, or look out upon the lovely views, or watch
the passing steamers and pleasure-boats, or observe the
countless green lizards which at Bellaggio, as elsewhere in
these warm regions, were constantly making rapid runs
over the paths.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we remained for about a fortnight, resting and
enjoying our rest. From our windows we looked across to
lofty mountains on the opposite shore, with Cadenabbia
and Menaggio lying at their foot, while away to the north
end of the lake a range of snowy peaks rose as if barricading
exit in that direction, and forming a fine, important
feature in the landscape. The Lake of Como is in fact
completely hemmed in by high, steep, bare mountains, which
fall with considerable abruptness down upon it, leaving but
a small border of land for cultivation and habitation. The
principal mountain opposite Bellaggio is San Crucione, which
rises to a sharp peak, taking six or seven hours to ascend;
but it is stated to command striking views of the snowy
Alps, and especially of the Monte Rosa chain, ‘une armée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
de géants.’ The mountain itself is no doubt a study for
the geologist, as it offers a most extraordinary exhibition of
upheaval of strata, the face of it showing in a great waving
line, commencing near the margin of the lake and sloping
up the face to near the top, a huge stratum of rock, which
in the distance appears to be of sandstone, but more likely
is of limestone formation, uplifted probably nearly 3000
feet.</p>

<p>The borders of Lake Como are fringed with trees, in
some places a few hundred feet up, and dotted with those
small, picturesque Italian villages, each with its church and
campanile, which always give such a charm to the landscape.</p>

<p class="p2">The town of Bellaggio is small but rather curious.
Where it borders the lake an arcade has been formed, with
terraces projecting from the houses and covering the roadway.
In this arcade and elsewhere a few small shops offer
articles for sale, and particularly small things in olive
wood, the manufacture of which is an industry of the
place. The wood is more darkly marked than at Sorrento
or in the south of France, sometimes to the extent of being
blotchy. Photographs, principally of the lake scenes and
sculptures in the neighbourhood, can be procured, but,
though good, they are dear for Italy.</p>

<p>Half-way up the hill at the foot of which Bellaggio stands,
reached by a steep road, is the Villa Serbelloni. This is
now a dependance of the ‘Grande Bretagne,’ and in the
season is said to be always full. It is a <i>pension</i> for protracted
stay, not for a passing night. What the comforts
of the house itself may be, whether the <i>pension</i> be good or
not, I do not know; but the house is most charmingly
situated, surrounded by the extensive grounds of the place,
nicely laid out with long terrace walks winding up the hill,
crowned on the top by the ruin of what was probably
an old castle. The hill is covered with trees, affording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
delicious shade from the sun, while the roses climb about
them to a height of 50 or 60 feet, and with the other
flowers make it a sort of enchanted land. From the top
of the hill, views are had all round and up the lake to the
snowy mountains of the Splugen Pass, and down the lake,
which here is forked, one prong running in the direction of
Como, and the other of Lecco.</p>

<p class="p2">It was hot sunshine all the time we were at Bellaggio,
diversified by two grand thunderstorms, accompanied by
vivid flashes of lightning, sheet and forked, one of which
flashes set fire to a tree or a church on the opposite
shore. It was a dreamy life, too hot to do very much; but
there was always a little excitement at the departure and
arrival of the steamboats, which go up and down the lake,
and to and from Lecco, several times a day; and if we had
no better amusement, it was great fun to feed the fishes
abounding in the lake; the water being so clear one could
see their every motion, and watch the caution with which,
proportioned to their age and consequent experience, they
would approach the bread. When a piece was thrown in,
there would be a general assembly to the spot. The young
ones would at once dart at it, trying to seize it, but, being
much too big for their little mouths, ineffectually. Then,
after a little, larger ones would come snuffing at it without
touching; by and by, perceiving no symptom of hook or
line, would get bolder, and, thinking all safe, would venture
to the attack. Then still larger ones would come and
swim in large circles round and round it, thinking, thinking,
till possibly the piece was gobbled up by younger ones
before their thoughts were matured. But generally there
would be quite a scramble and a splutter, twenty fishes
together, after a single piece, which got less and less by
successive dabs, till a big fellow made a dart and swallowed
it whole. But sometimes the piece was too large for even
his throat; it was speedily disgorged, and then another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
scramble took place, till it wholly disappeared among
them.</p>

<p class="p2">A charming variety in our life was to take one of the
small pleasure-boats, always lying at the hotel quay for
engagement, and pull about on the lake, although at noon
it was fully too hot even for that. Still we had several
delightful sails upon the lake. One of these was across to
the Villa Carlotta. This residence contains some exquisite
sculptures, particularly the ‘Cupid and Psyche’ by Canova,
which, by means of photographs, and sometimes in alabaster
copies, is so well known. Also ‘Innocence,’ a winged youth
or maiden holding a pair of doves, by Bien Aimé; and
a large frieze, with reliefs, by Thorwaldsen, which cost
£15,000. The hall in which this beautiful collection of
sculptures is placed does not seem worthy of it. It looks
rather like a receptacle or storage room till the proper
hall be ready; but one would almost wish that such gems
of art could be seen in a less inaccessible place. The
grounds of the villa are delightful; the vegetation is quite
tropical, while the views are superb, especially looking
across to Bellaggio and the lofty mountains bordering the
other side of Lake Lecco, which tower like a huge wall
of rock behind the Serbelloni Hill. Returning to our
boat, we rowed round the coast, which contains very many
luxuriant spots; one of the most lovely of these was a
little summer-house by the banks of the lake, filled with
graceful drooping acacias and brilliant summer flowers&mdash;one
of those ‘juicy bits’ which artists so much prize.</p>

<p>On another occasion we visited the Villa Melzi, lying
upon the Bellaggio side. It contains some good sculptures,
but not equal to those in the Villa Carlotta. The gardens,
however, were fascinating&mdash;shady walks with sloping grass
banks, lofty trees, and all by the margin of the smiling
lake. One could hardly imagine a more romantic residence,
but the proprietor occupies it only two months in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
year&mdash;September and October. We did long for the power
of transplanting such places, with all their sunshine and
clear blue sky, to our native land.</p>

<p class="p2">The sail in the steamboat to Como takes about two
hours, and is a very charming excursion. The lake winds
about among the mountains, and the boat, crossing from
side to side, touches every now and then at one of those
picturesque Italian villages which adorn the lake and form
such admirable subjects for the painter’s brush. At the
south end, where the town of Como lies, the mountains
dwindle down to insignificant hills, and the town is built
for the most part on a large level plain, which probably
has been gained from the lake by deposit. The town
is one of some size, its principal ornament being the
cathedral, a large and imposing church with a dome built
of white marble, and finely ornamented within by sculpture.
This and the adjoining Broletto, or Town Hall,
built in alternate courses of black and white marble,
with an open arcade below, and an old tower by its side,
are, with the cathedral, the attractions of the ancient city
of Como.</p>

<p>The sail in the other direction, towards the snowy mountains,
is much grander, and also takes about two hours,
stopping at Colico. The sail upon Lake Lecco we did not
take.</p>

<p class="p2">It was too hot to walk to any distance, but one forenoon
two of us ventured exploringly as far as St. Giovanni, a
small fishing village with two churches, about a mile or
more to the south of Bellaggio. Here quantities of the fish
caught in the lake by means of nets were hanging up to
dry and be baked in the sun. On our way we passed a
monument in course of erection to some Principe, whose
name I did not gather, curiously composed of a combination
of red brick, granite, and marble; and not far off the ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
of a church, whose tall square campanile, remaining standing,
was an object in the landscape.</p>

<p>In one of our walks, we found lying on the road one
after another three small snakes, which had been killed
and left there. They were probably about 15 inches in
length and ⅝ths of an inch thick.</p>

<p class="p2">We had a continuance of hot weather, and in those
glorious days this was generally the even tenor of our way.
In the early morning, too soon to rise and dress, but tempted
to look out at window, we could see that the sun was
illuminating the snowy peaks of the Splugen range, and
casting a brilliant light on San Crucione and all the hills on
that, the other side of the lake. By nine o’clock the sun
had obtained power; but it was a great joy to go out after
breakfast and stroll under the shade of the trees by the
banks of the limpid blue water, and look across its lustrous
expanse to the opposite shore, fringed with verdure, out of
which rose the giant mountains circling the lake, and over
all to the clear blue Italian sky, making, with the broad
snowy range of peaks in the north, one of the loveliest
pictures we had seen in Italy. Then, when the sun came
round to the south, the air, heated as by a furnace, trembled
with the sultry glow, and all blinds were drawn down, and
the houses looked asleep. Everything was still, save when
at given hours the steamboat paddles beat upon the water,
or the bell announced arrival or departure. We would
return to the hotel for shade and coolness, have lunch,
read our letters or answer them, dip into the newspapers,
say good-bye to those who were leaving, or sometimes be
gladdened by meeting old travelling friends just come; or,
failing any more important occupation, take up a book and
withdraw to a sofa in the great cool <i>salon</i>, to obtain a quiet
read. Then in time the dressing-bell would ring, and we
would shortly after assemble at dinner, and enjoy pleasant
intercourse with those around. Dinner over, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
visitors, especially among those just arrived, would embark
in pleasure-boats upon the lake; and others (ladies throwing
a shawl over the shoulders, and a hat upon the head)
would sit out in the garden a good while, conversing and
looking upon the fair prospect and the boats gliding along,
their oars gently touching and turning the silver water and
leaving a ripple behind; and, by and by, the sun would
retire and set behind the mountains; and though the lesser
orb, being then in its infancy, could not afford us the
resplendent spectacle of full moon on the lake, the stars
were on the <i>qui vive</i>, and, stealthily sending their pale
twinkling scouts to peep timidly out and reconnoitre, would
all, the moment the enemy disappeared, with bold face rise,
each in its appointed position, and, as they slowly and
silently, but steadily, pursued the sun in his flight, hang
out their far-shining lamps, radiant in green and gold, to
light up the beauteous scene. The very rapture of the
frogs, as they maintained, agreeably to themselves, an incessant
‘wrack-wrack,’ seemed not out of place; while the
glow-worm, with greater humanity, and in greater keeping
with all around, would turn upon the garden paths its
glittering tail. But as it became dark, and visitors had
one by one retreated to the house, it would happen that
either from our shore or from the Cadenabbia shore, the
hotelkeepers began to burn coloured lights, ignite fireworks,
and send rockets blazing and bursting high up into the air;
and, this show being over, it was time to retire to rest, and,
if the heat would admit of sleep, perchance to repeat our
experience of the day in visions of the night, and wake
on the morrow for another such day. And so, like many
others similarly placed, we dreamed away this blissful
fortnight.</p>

<p class="p2">But we were now in the middle of June, and the season
seemed to be drawing to a close, and probably a month
later, when the sun’s heat would be intolerable, Bellaggio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
might become altogether deserted. The numbers at the
hotel lessened day by day, so that for a week I was at the
head of the table as the oldest inhabitant. It was warning
we must move on. We must leave this land of Beulah;
bid adieu for a time to the sunny soil and sky of Italy,
where we had now spent nearly four months, and proceed
to the cooler regions of Switzerland by the neighbouring
Splugen Pass.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>THE SPLUGEN PASS, SWITZERLAND.</i></p>

<h3>THE SPLUGEN PASS.</h3>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Vetturini</span> are always hanging about the hotels at Bellaggio,
to be engaged either by the landlords or directly by
travellers, although their usual course is to refer the
inquirer to the landlord, to arrange with whom no doubt
they have an understanding. But one labours under the
disadvantage, by hiring at Bellaggio, of not seeing either
the carriage or the cattle which are to convey you over the
mountain&mdash;perhaps, too, in a thunderstorm. Therefore,
and because of the high charge at the hotels, I took, before
travelling, the steamer to Colico at the head of the lake,
and arranged for a carriage thence to be waiting the
arrival of the boat on the following Monday; and an English
gentleman and his wife agreed to accompany us.</p>

<p class="p2">Monday proved a fine day, without too much sun, and
we left Bellaggio by steamer at half-past ten with not a
little regret. The sail up the lake, amongst the bold
mountains with which it is enclosed, and by the nine little
Italian villages on its margin, to visit which the steamer
crosses from side to side, giving thus alternately the view from
each side at different points, is very enjoyable, although it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
was trying to think we were so soon to bid adieu to it all.
At Colico the mountains are rugged and bare, and the lake
gets very marshy, so that the locality is unhealthy. Here
the carriage was ready for us, and it took about three
hours’ drive to reach Chiavenna, the road winding for a
long way by the Lagunes of the lake. Upon leaving
Colico we were immediately among the mountains, the
road gradually ascending. The drive was beautiful, but
extremely dusty.</p>

<p>Chiavenna is an Italian and old Roman village town
about 1100 feet above the level of the sea, very
picturesquely buried among the bluff high mountains
which closely hem it in on every side, and upon the
heights of some of which patches of snow were visible in
many places. It lies at the foot of the Splugen Pass, and
on the river Maira, which, crossed by a good stone bridge,
pours a torrent of water down from the snowy heights.
We had time, both before dinner and after, to stroll about
and see the little that was to be seen. Chiavenna is celebrated
for its beer, and we thought it our duty to try it as
the wine of the country, expecting to get it in perfection,
but found it very flat. We had had it better at
Bellaggio.</p>

<p class="p2">Soon after seven o’clock the following morning, we left
the hotel, and had three hours of a most laborious ascent to
Campo Dolcino, only eight miles distant. The three horses
with which we started, afterwards supplemented by a fourth,
toiled up innumerable zigzags, getting higher and higher at
every turn, but making very little onward progress; so that
generally some of us would get out of the carriage, and by
climbing up at the end of one zigzag to the end of the
next, meet its slow arrival there. The distant views as we
proceeded were fine, and improved the higher we mounted;
while in the narrow valley beneath,&mdash;farther and farther
beneath as we got higher and higher,&mdash;the river was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
wending its foamy course, augmented at little intervals by
every fresh rivulet which rushed to embrace it from the
lovely waterfalls descending in long, silver-grey, horsetail
streams from the mountains opposite, in bright white
contrast with the brown rocks over which they dashed and
fell. There is not much to be seen at Campo Dolcino.
It is a small village in a bleak-looking district; but,
stopping for three hours to rest the horses, look about,
and obtain lunch at the little inn, we proceeded on our
way up the pass. Soon afterwards we reached the
Madesimo waterfall, which is near to the road; and all
turned out to see this famous cascade from a small stone
gallery above it, whence the water is observed rolling over
and tumbling and sinking in one grand heap 700 feet
down, scattering, by the mere force of the descent, into a
cloud of spray below. Little by little we continued ascending,
passing in the way through three long tunnels (one
of them 1530 feet in length), built to protect from the
avalanches, which at certain seasons would otherwise bury
the road; and at last we reached the region of perpetual
snow, where the inaccessible Alpine roses bloom, and
amidst blue gentians springing from the banks on the
roadside. Mile after mile we passed along the road cut
through the snow, not pure or clean, standing consolidated
on each side, like the Red Sea when the Israelites
passed over its channel and the waters were divided and
became ‘a wall unto them on their right hand and on their
left;’ very possibly by the action of frost upon the sea as
it fled from the pressure of the fierce east wind which
made the sea dry land. But though there was no fear of
our experiencing the fate of Pharaoh’s host, our walls were
slowly melting away in little trickling streamlets at every
part, under the influence of the hot sun, no doubt to be
made good again by a snowstorm from the next moisture
in the air. As we approached the top of the pass, the
scene became wild and dreary. Immense fields of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
lay spread out in a melting condition, sending down
innumerable streams, all converging on the river which
descends to Chiavenna, and by whose side, though generally
at a great elevation above, our road had all along lain, the
large roaring torrent at Chiavenna being here but a small
turbid stream. But the cold-looking, slushy snow-field
afforded an admirable notion of how these rivers are fed.</p>

<p class="p2">We reached the summit, which is 6945 feet high, and is
surrounded by lofty mountains, one of them 9925 feet,
and another 10,748 feet high, covered with their white
mantle, and, by an optical illusion, looking nearer and
lower than they really were. The feeling (perhaps arising
out of our having been so lately in the midst of all that
was suggestive of heat) was strange upon finding ourselves
in the vicinity of such cold peaks, and very much as if
we had been suddenly tumbled into the arctic regions&mdash;desolate,
barren, impassable retreats for man, and yet not
altogether so; for the boundary line between Switzerland
and Italy lies at the top of the pass, and not far below this
great altitude the Italian <i>douane</i> station has been built.
One would imagine the position hardly tenable by the poor
custom-house men in winter months. The traveller into
Switzerland, however, is not troubled by any <i>douanier</i>.</p>

<p>Here two of the horses were liberated, and dashing down
with the remaining two along many zigzags, we gradually
came in sight of the village of Splugen, 2200 feet below,
and about five miles distant from the summit, passing by on
the way a river which gradually got larger and larger, and
proved to be the source, or one of the sources, of the Rhine.
We arrived about half-past five, making it a journey of
fully ten hours to traverse a distance, between Chiavenna
and Splugen, at least as the crow flies, of not more than
sixteen miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<h3>SWITZERLAND.</h3>

<p>We remained in Switzerland from the 19th June to the
11th September, nearly three months; and as I wish to
notice our movements in it, for the most part in well-beaten
paths, merely by way of connection, I shall do so
very briefly. We had decided to spend another winter in
the Riviera, and with a view to this to pass the remainder of
the summer in Switzerland, and thereafter cross over France
to Pau and Biarritz, to spend there the period intervening,
till it should be time to move onwards to Mentone.</p>

<p class="p2">The Swiss village of Splugen has a southern exposure,
and lies very picturesquely with its church on the slope and
top of a little eminence, at an altitude of 4757 feet above
the sea, overlooking a valley out of which lofty mountains
raise their heads, one of them to the north behind the
village itself. Pine forests are planted on the slopes,
affording, no doubt, a little shelter from the cold north
winds. Like all such places, it looks best at a little
distance; and, approaching it from the opposite hill, it
seemed a pretty village of wooden houses, built in the
Swiss chalet style, and therefore quite a change from the
Italian houses to which our eyes had been for the last few
months accustomed. The accommodation was primitive.
We were lodged in a large wooden hotel. The temperature,
too, and the aspect of everything was changed. We had
bidden adieu to the heat of Italy, and found it much colder
upon the northern side of the mountains. This produced
an accident which was annoying to me, and created a good
deal of after trouble, as in winding up my watch at night
the chain gave way, I presume, owing to the jump from
great heat to frosty cold to which it had been subjected.
The attempt I afterwards made in Switzerland to get
it repaired only made matters worse, and the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
repair at home costly. One would almost require to carry
a spare watch in travelling among these localities. We had
time to see a little of Splugen in the evening. The fields
were literally covered with bright flowers, tempting us
to pluck many handfuls. Although standing so high, the
valley does not give one the impression of its great
elevation.</p>

<p class="p2">Before eight o’clock next morning, we started for
Coire. Down and down we drove by the banks of the
roaring and foaming Rhine, the road and river being
beautifully wooded. The drive was most charming. At
every mile the river got larger, while the mountains reared
their heads above, to heights varying from 8,000 to 11,000
feet. In about two hours’ time we reached the Via Mala,
where the mountains or rocks converge, and the river dashes
far below, in some places nearly hidden by the pines thickly
set upon the precipitous banks, wherever they can obtain a
footing. At one time the pass may have been a dangerous
one; but now, although it be still impressive, the road is
good, and there is nothing to fear, notwithstanding the cliffs
rise perpendicularly to a great height, higher even than
they appear to do. Yet, were a mass of rock to loosen and
fall, and block up the road or tear it away, it would be
decidedly awkward for persons passing. The gorge, at
which you look straight up and straight down, is well seen
from a bridge, where a man was ready to plump a big
stone into the torrent far down in the depths below. Everybody
walks through the pass; the most indifferent to grand
effects could hardly sit still in his carriage. I suppose it
is possible to get to some safe place near the water, as
photographs have been taken looking up to the bridge; and
so seen, it appears perched high above, over steep and even
impending rocks, which, save for a tree here and there, are
smooth and bare, and form a narrow, ugly, perilous cleft,
through which the river flows at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Emerging from the pass, and just out of it, we reached
the clean and tidy but shadeless village of Thusis, which
lay basking in the hot sun, though not so hot as we had
had it at Lake Como. There is a good hotel here, but
one might well dispense in such places with men-waiters,
black coats, and white ties. From the garden of the hotel,
an excellent view is had of the entrance to the pass. Here
we rested two and a half hours, and then drove on to Coire
by the banks of the Rhine, looking up to the lofty mountains
with their snowy tops, and across a well-wooded
landscape. At Coire there is a railway to Zurich, by which
we had intended to proceed; but, arranging with the driver,
he took us on to Ragatz, about two hours farther, where we
arrived at half-past five, the last half hour being in a
thunderstorm. It had been down hill the whole way since
we left Splugen in the morning, and the horses, notwithstanding
the fatigues of the preceding day, went briskly
along, and apparently returned next morning; for it is not
the habit of the owners of these Swiss conveyances, if they
can help it, to give their horses a day’s rest after excessive
fatigue. We enjoyed our three days’ drive amazingly,
through scenery alternately grand, wild and desolate, or
beautiful and romantic. A more pleasant excursion could
not be planned; but to be enjoyed, it requires to be taken
in the way we did. One has not the same freedom in
travelling by diligence, and besides it goes on night and
day, and passes through the best of the scenery in the dark.</p>

<p class="p2">Ragatz lies a little beyond the range of the usual tourists’
track, and we had not ourselves visited it before. It is
very charmingly situated, at the entrance of the Gorge of
Pfäffers, in a valley up from that of the Rhine flow, and
hemmed in by high, bold mountains, which, from the
Ragatz side, look like immense walls, on whose higher
slopes some patches of snow were then visible. The village
is small and spotlessly clean, externally at least, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
Hotel Quellenhoff, a large new comfortable house, has
grounds attached to it which afford pleasant retreats and
walks. It is, however, a somewhat noisy establishment,
being one of those Continental watering-places where a
band of music, paid for by a daily tax on each visitor,
plays morning and night to the accompaniment of out-door
drinking. We found the house full of Germans, and having
one or two distinguished visitors, among whom were the
King of Saxony and Count Arnim. In the public breakfast
room we found one morning four Germans smoking at
a table&mdash;a disgusting piece of rudeness which is sometimes
experienced in Switzerland. In the grounds there are a
kursaal, where the band plays, a newsroom, and a book-seller’s
stall&mdash;all under one roof; and in another neat range
of buildings, shops for the sale of Swiss and other articles,
a fountain flowing with Pfäffers water, and baths of the
same.</p>

<p class="p2">The walk up the Pfäffers Gorge is very interesting.
Crossing a rustic wooden bridge over a deep rapid torrent,
not very wide, however, the road at once begins to lead into
a confined valley, the rocks or hills on either side rising
steeply, and leaving room only for the river and the road
by its side, with an occasional widening. It is well wooded
all along, the pine trees affording shelter to some extent
from the sun when it penetrates, as it does in certain
positions. The seclusion is alluring, but it is not altogether
free from danger. At one place my daughter ran up a
bank, and came flying back to say that she had found a
snake moving in the grass at her feet. An older person,
less observant, would in all likelihood have trod upon it.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
As we proceeded, the mountains seemed to rise higher and
higher overhead; and, about two and a half miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Ragatz, the rocks approach still closer, and a large hotel,
seemingly very much out of place, greets the eye. Here
tickets are procured for entrance to the gorge itself.
It is effected through the hotel to a wooden gallery
resting on a ledge cut out of the rock, which impends
at a by no means assuring acute angle immediately overhead,
and even some way beyond the shaky platform.
Looking down the abyss, the water is seen below flowing
still and deep and fast through the narrow cleft; and
this cleft rises high, as we can see the rocks appearing
to all but touch above, while one side inclines to the
other with an apparent appalling desire to embrace. It
looks as if an earthquake had split up the rock, and as
if another shock might at once and for ever close it up
again. It is a damp, gloomy sort of cavern, till one reaches
the part where the hot spring escapes from the rocks, one
half of it flowing into the river in a huge spout, and the
remainder being carried in a long pipe to Ragatz to supply
the baths there. We entered by a door into a cave in the
rock, a distance of probably 50 or 60 feet, pitch dark, hot,
and vaporous, where we had given us a little of the hot
water to drink, not disagreeable to the taste. Afraid of
chill, we left in time to get back to Ragatz ere the road
should be in shade.</p>

<p class="p2">We should have stayed at Ragatz with pleasure for at
least a week, but, expecting letters at Lucerne, remained
only three nights. Leaving the hotel at half-past eight,
we had a tedious journey, as we did not arrive at Lucerne
(only about 76 miles distant by rail) till four o’clock, the
railway passing through a very pretty country, well wooded
and watered, stopping at every station by the way, and for
an hour at the town of Zurich. Leaving in sunshine, we
were again unfortunate enough to arrive at Lucerne in
heavy rain, which, with previous falls, had caused the lake
to overflow its banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>We spent three nights at Lucerne, and had rain great
part of the time. We were fortunate, however, to obtain,
on the Tuesday, a charming sunny day to cross the lake
and proceed by diligence to Interlachen by the Brunig
Pass. The steamboat left the quay at Lucerne at 10.10
for Alpnacht, and we did not get to Interlachen till about
8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, having had, however, two long halts by the way to
enable the passengers to dine or obtain refreshment and
to rest the horses. We had the interior of the diligence
to ourselves, and, though objecting at first to the closeness,
it afforded cover from the sun, then in full power.
The other passengers were accommodated in other and
open carriages. The sail and drive are both beautiful; the
sunset upon the Jungfrau awaiting our arrival was one
of the finest we enjoyed while at Interlachen, tinting
the snow with a shining glow of bright red light, which
gradually left the lower parts till the shade ascended to
the summit; and then the whole mountain was as if dead,
but it shortly after returned to life in the like ruddy hue
of the after-glow,&mdash;a beautiful effect we did not often
afterwards witness.</p>

<p class="p2">We had several times visited Interlachen before. It
was at this time very empty. We had arrived in the
German season, and there were few but Germans there.
The English do not generally begin to come to Switzerland
until the middle or end of July, when Interlachen becomes
crowded, and it is difficult to secure good accommodation.
We found little change in the place since we were last
there (five years previously), but the prices of the Swiss
carvings on wood exhibited in the shops had risen very
considerably.</p>

<p>Interlachen, with which we had many associations, is a
charming spot at which to remain for some time, and I
arranged for my family to stay at the Jungfrau Hotel <i>en
pension</i>, which they did for above two months, and during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
part of this time I went home on a flying visit. It is an
admirable centre for excursions, while the place itself is,
especially in the height of the season, exceedingly attractive.
The hotels are for the most part situated on the north side
of the high road conducting in one direction to Thun and
Berne, and in the other to Brienz, Meyringen, and Lucerne,
always full of life. Though the hotels are large, they
retreat from the road, and have not the towny look which
large hotels generally have. The trees, and the flowers, and
the pretty chalets, and the wood-carving shops, and the
background of mountains&mdash;all confer a rustic look, as seen
from the highway, which is greatly enhanced by the large
open field so properly kept open upon the south side of
the road, lined by fine old trees, between which one
catches sight of the picturesque church and the equally
picturesque houses at some distance, and behind them the
ranges of green mountains and the conical tree-covered hill
called the Jungfraublick; but beyond all, the grand view
of the majestic snow-clad Jungfrau itself, fifteen miles off,
seen at the termination of the magnificent vista afforded by
the gap in the mountains which lie between it and Interlachen;
by a road through which Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen,
the Wengern Alp, and the Murren are reached&mdash;all
glorious excursions.</p>

<p>Then there are the Lakes of Thun and Brienz, both
affording delightful steamboat trips, and in the locality round
about innumerable walks. However, like most places among
the mountains, great changes in the weather often take
place, and frequent thunderstorms with drenching rain,
intermingled with glowing hot days, are experienced. We
had a fair share of both.</p>

<p class="p2">When I thought to make a run to Scotland, I found
that leaving by a train to Berne at 9.50 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and proceeding
by Neufchatel and Dijon, I could get to Paris by 5.35
next morning, stopping two hours by the way at Berne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
On the return journey, leaving Paris at 7.40 evening, I
did not get to Interlachen till near dinner-time next day,
being compelled to spend four hours again at Berne. These
stoppages are annoying to those who have been at Berne
before, and, as a train leaves just immediately antecedent to
the arrival of the train from the north, they might at least
in that case easily be avoided. But probably the intention
is to compel a short stay at Berne.</p>

<p class="p2">We had heard Chateau d’&OElig;x highly spoken of as a
pleasant, cool retreat, where we might be invigorated by
Highland breezes for the coming winter.</p>

<p>Having engaged a carriage for this rather long drive, we
left Interlachen on 28th August about 7.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and had
a splendid but cruelly hot day. The distance, I should
imagine, might possibly be fifty miles, if so much; for certainly
we did not go on an average at a greater speed than
five miles per hour,&mdash;considerable part of the way being
indeed just crawling up the hill. After leaving Interlachen
by the south bank of Lake Thun, we soon got into the
shade of the hill, and it was chilly, causing all wraps to
be in requisition. Reaching high ground over Spiez, we
took our last view of Interlachen in the distance, with the
smoke of morning fires hanging over it. From this point
the road lay in a long valley between two ranges of hills,
which, after those we had been so long looking upon, did
not appear high. Everything was now in bright sunshine,
and the valley and the slopes were so verdant and luxuriant
as to make the drive lovely, though scarcely, except at one
or two parts, could it be called grand. We passed many
little villages, all looking so sleepy in the sun, but evidently
prosperous. Soon after twelve we stopped at the little
town of Boltigen, to rest the horses for two hours and dine
at the hotel with the sign, life-size, of the gilded bear, kept
by a pleasant young woman, who strove to make us comfortable.
The road after Boltigen was still up hill till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
reached a point whence descent is made to Sarnen, the
centre of the famous Gruyère cheese district, and soon after
we came in sight of Chateau d’&OElig;x, with its picturesque
church, formerly a castle, on the top of an isolated conical
hill, from which the small town takes its name. This
chateau or church at once arrests the eye, and gives character
to the place; but the town itself lies at the foot of the
eminence, and is 3260 feet above the sea. Bold mountains,
well wooded, rise on every side, and are probably,
some of them, 5000 or 6000 feet high&mdash;all contributing to
fill a considerable river in the valley a good way below.
There are several hotels in the town, and chalet pensions
on the slopes above, the pension in all being amazingly
moderate, somewhat upon the scale which formerly prevailed
throughout Switzerland. The Hotel Berthod, at
which we stopped, accommodates about eighty people, and
is built of wood, the appointments being somewhat rough,
though clean. The season is short, but the hotel is for
part of the time full. As it is so much out of the beaten
track, the society is probably more select than it sometimes
is in other parts of Switzerland. For the active, there are
abundance of nice walks in the immediate neighbourhood.
The air, though in day-time hot, was invigorating; but as
we were getting near the end of the season, it had a tendency
at night at this elevation to get cold. We therefore
only spent eight days there, though very pleasantly.</p>

<p class="p2">On leaving Chateau d’&OElig;x, we took the diligence to the
pretty large town of Aigle, and to reach it had slowly to
ascend the mountains to an altitude of between 5000 and
6000 feet. It was a most charming ride or walk, and I got
out and walked several miles ahead of the lumbering
conveyance. The descent from the summit of the pass
continues to Sepey, a village where we halted for lunch,
and said to be another charming centre, with pension
upon the same moderate scale as we had just experienced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
The views here were very fine, but the place itself
did not strike me as so desirable as Chateau d’&OElig;x,
although it has the advantage of being more accessible.
From Sepey we descended to Aigle, where there is a large
hotel or hydropathic establishment just out of the town.
The diligence deposited us at the railway station nearly an
hour previous to the train to Montreux on the Lake of
Geneva being due.</p>

<p>From its comparatively sheltered situation, Montreux is
much frequented during winter months, and it is a little
warmer than Geneva or Lausanne; but during part of the
winter the temperature of Montreux is, I believe, lower
than that of London and Edinburgh, so that possibly it
may therefore not be suitable as a winter resort for those
having delicate constitutions. The picturesque and interesting
Castle of Chillon lies about two miles off, nearer the
upper end of the lake. Our bedroom windows commanded
the view of the lake, together with the Dent du Midi in
the distance, so that the prospect was always pleasing.
Montreux is rather too much of a town, and the walls and
houses shut out almost completely the sight of the lake
from the road or street. The adjoining town of Clarens,
nearly united to it, appears to be, on the whole, nicer for
summer residence.</p>

<p>After being at Montreux for a few days, we left by the
steamboat, and had a lovely sail to Geneva, where, in the
afternoon, just before dinner, we obtained a good glimpse
of Mont Blanc in the distance unveiled. Besting one
night, we proceeded to Lyons by train next day, and were
once more in France.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>BIARRITZ.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">I had</span> thought it might have been possible to arrange for
proceeding across country from Lyons to Biarritz by a
westerly line, say by Clermont, instead of by the Mediterranean
line, which we had already travelled. But although
there are lines in that direction, it seemed extremely difficult
to make them fit in so that we could, upon stopping
at any place, obtain next day a train at a suitable hour for
prosecuting the journey. Not only so, but being quite out
of the ordinary beat of tourists, and especially of English
tourists, one could not possibly rely on getting such hotel
accommodation by the way as is desirable and is procurable
on the beaten tracks. I therefore gave up this thought,
though not till after some laborious studies of the <i>Livret
Chaix</i>, and after consulting Cook’s agent at Geneva, who, I
found, did not issue tickets towards Biarritz. There seemed
no alternative, therefore, but to go by the Chemin de Fer du
Midi, the Paris and Marseilles Railway. We had hoped, it
being the 12th September, to have seen the Rhone in all
its summer beauty, but were disappointed. The day was
dull and misty when we started, and soon after it began to
rain; so that we could see little, and everything looked
dismal, whereas in summer sunshine the prospect is no doubt
very lovely. Before we reached Avignon (in six hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
ten minutes) the rain ceased. We stopped a night there
(see p. 135), and had fortunately good weather. Next
afternoon brought us to Nismes, two hours distant from
Avignon by rail; and after another night in our old quarters
there, and seeing places this time in sunshine instead of
shrouded by the mistral, which prevailed during our visit in
the previous year, we left at mid-day for Toulouse, arriving
at this large city about eleven o’clock at night. There
is not another train by which we could have proceeded from
Nismes to Toulouse during day, nor is there any place nearer
Toulouse where it is desirable to stop except Montpellier;
but Montpellier is only an hour distant from Nismes,
and better adapted, therefore, for stoppage coming from
Toulouse on the return journey, and on our return journey
we accordingly spent a night there. Cette, where we
changed carriages and were long detained for no apparent
good reason, and where there are extensive salines or
manufactories of salt, lies very low and is marshy. It is
therefore considered a most unhealthy spot, not to be thought
of for sleeping at. The journey to Cette is not particularly
interesting. Beyond it to Toulouse the country is more
inviting. The distance is about 136 miles, and the train
most tiresomely stopped several minutes at every little
station, twenty-nine or thirty in all, with an extra halt
at Narbonne, amounting to twenty minutes, where a hasty
though acceptable dinner waited the arrival of the train.
The more interesting part of the road was passed in the
dark.</p>

<p class="p2">We had been recommended by fellow-passengers to the
Hotel Sacaron at Toulouse, and found it remarkably comfortable;
but to all appearance it was then out of season, as
we seemed to be the only guests, except it might be our old
friends the mosquitoes, who, paying nothing but penalties,
were unceasing in their attentions, and from whom we
might have suffered more than we did had we not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
well protected by the snowy-white mosquito curtains. Our
daughter, however, had a long watch, and discovered in the
morning her forehead was jewelled in thirty-two holes.</p>

<p>Leaving next morning for Pau by the 11 o’clock train,
we had no opportunity of getting more than a glimpse at
this important provincial town. The houses are large,
and the streets&mdash;such of them as we saw&mdash;are wide. The
railway station is handsome and tidy. We arrived at
Pau about 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, by a quick or express train, having
only stopped at eleven out of thirty-four stations. Notwithstanding
it took us six hours to go little more than
130 miles, being at the rate of 22 miles per hour. However,
it was an improvement upon the previous day’s
travelling. The only other trains by which we could have
gone from Toulouse to Pau were two,&mdash;one which left at
midnight, getting in at 10 o’clock next morning; and
another which left at 5.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, getting to Pau at half-past
1. I mention these facts just to show that every
consideration is not paid here, and elsewhere (and it is better
here than elsewhere) on French lines, to the convenience of
travellers. Apart from the disagreeableness of starting at
such inhuman hours, to travel by the midnight train would
be to miss for great part of the way the view of the most
interesting scenery along the railway route, which skirts
the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>These grand mountains we saw now for the first time.
Near to Lourdes the railway approaches them closely, and
the church of Lourdes, to which it has been customary of
recent years to make pilgrimages, is not far from the railway.
It rises loftily from the ground far below. A crowd of
pilgrims was marching towards its supposed miraculous
shrines. The scenery about Lourdes is very picturesque,
and the railway to Pau for a great part of the way runs
parallel to and overlooks a mountain river, apparently the
Adour, very much resembling at this part such rivers as
the Garry in Perthshire: a clear-flowing stream, descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
through a rocky bed, with many a rushing fall or rapid
between converging rocks.</p>

<p>We arrived at Pau on the Saturday afternoon, and left it
on the following Tuesday morning&mdash;just having time to rest.
I reserve, therefore, any observations regarding Pau till our
return journey, when we spent a longer time there. The
railway ride (between sixty and seventy miles) from Pau
to Bayonne is very beautiful, part of the way being by
the banks of the Adour, which, as it approaches Bayonne,
becomes wide, and is, indeed, navigable for forty miles up.
We were advised to book to Bayonne, and hire thence to
Biarritz; but I found the fares asked for the drive so
excessive, occasioned, as we afterwards learnt, by races
being then held at Bayonne, that we took the train just
about to start on to Biarritz. The station La Negresse
proved, however, to be two miles out of Biarritz, and only
one carriage was waiting disengaged. For this short distance
I was charged 8 francs; certainly exorbitant, but during the
season at Biarritz everything is very high, and the races
had then taken off the usual supply of vehicles, so that we
were at the mercy of the gorgeously-attired coachman, who
drove us in by a pretty rural road between trees and hedges.
In all likelihood he had driven a party to join the train we
had just left, so that we may have been indebted even to
this chance for finding any conveyance waiting. I do not
know why the railway company laid their line so far away
from the town, unless it was that they did not appreciate
the importance of the station. As an attempt to remedy
the evil, a short line intended to connect Bayonne specially
with Biarritz has been made; but though the Biarritz
terminus is tolerably near the centre of the town, the other
terminus does not enter Bayonne, and is a long way from
the general railway terminus. It may be useful for
excursionists, but it is useless for other traffic, and I should
hardly think it would pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>We had been recommended to the Hotel de Paris, near
the rocks, and, with some difficulty, the town being then
very full, got accommodation in it; rough enough at the
first, but after two nights we obtained a change to first-floor
rooms, fairly good. The hotel is situated in a public square
planted with trees, the north end being open, overlooking
the sea. Here the band played every evening, Sunday
included, from half-past 8 till 10 o’clock during the season,
making our rooms for the time very noisy; but as our
windows looked right down upon the seated enclosure,
brightly lighted up with numerous lamps, it was a little
variety and divertisement to watch the gay crowd with
whom it was at first filled, who paid for admission half
a franc each. The charges in the hotels and for lodgings
at Biarritz are said to be, during the summer season,
immoderately high, and to cost in some cases as much as
£5 per day. I cannot help thinking, however, that there
must be a little exaggeration in these statements, or some
extravagance on the part of the visitor so charged. We
were ourselves charged at no excessive rate. The Angleterre
and Grand Hotels, with superior arrangements, I believe,
charged a good deal more. But there are other and more
moderate hotels, such as the Hotel de France and the Hotel
des Ambassadeurs, which, however, are both in the town
itself, and not so well situated as those I have already
named.</p>

<p class="p2">We remained at Biarritz till 13th October, nearly four
weeks, and enjoyed it very much, although for a considerable
part of the time, particularly during the earlier part,
east and north-east winds, said to be unusual, prevailed,
rendering the place for the time being cold, and giving us a
taste of what winter weather is there, a visitor informing us
that he had not found it colder in winter. If, however, it
be no colder on winter days than what we did experience,
it could hardly be described as trying for persons in good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
strong health; but the prevailing winds are west and south-west,
both mild and salubrious, though sometimes the south
wind blows, and brings with it, in the hot months, the
parching heat of the sirocco.</p>

<p>Biarritz is a place of very recent growth. Formerly
nobody but English people, for the sake of the bathing it
afforded, frequented it. Afterwards the civil war of succession
in Spain brought many of the best Spanish families to
live in it as a frontier town and among others the Countess
de Montijo and her two daughters, one of whom became the
wife of Napoleon <span class="smcap">III.</span> Her fondness for the place induced
the Emperor to build the Villa Eugenie as a marine residence,
and so, practically, made this delightful watering-place.</p>

<p>There may be said to be two bays, one north and one south;
the first lying between the lighthouse and the pier, and
the second upon the Basque beach. In the centre of the
north bay the Villa Eugenie reposes on a rocky eminence,
40 or 50 feet above the shore to the east of the town, and
is seen from many points. East and west of it, the sloping
beach, a fine sandy one, stretches away on the right hand
to the steep rocks, about 70 feet high, under the lighthouse,
resting on a jutting promontory forming the eastern enclosing
arm, to the rocks on the west, among which, looking
down the small harbour, may be seen the town lying
above and back from them. Westward from the Villa
Eugenie, perhaps about half a mile distant, an imposing
range of lofty hotels&mdash;the Grand Hotel and the Angleterre,
with the Casino between them, all towering many storeys
high&mdash;meets the view, and beyond them we see the spire of
a large town church; and then still beyond, outward to the
sea, running to a point, a range of high rocks or small hills
which enclose the bay on the west. Some of the hilly
rocks are surmounted by houses, and one prominent one by
a semaphore or signal station. The rocks afford some
shelter to the beach from the fury of the waves, but are
themselves gradually giving way. No doubt at one time
they formed a strong natural breakwater and better barrier,
and extended well out into the ocean; but year by year
they are succumbing to the force of the Atlantic and the
storms which visit the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>In the centre of the north bay, and to the westward of
the Villa Eugenie, a short promenade has been formed, on
or adjoining which the great bathing establishment has
been erected, the beach here being called the Grande Plage,
in contradistinction to the other beaches. From the west
end of it the road winds up below the Casino and past
the Angleterre, and along by the top of the rocks overlooking
the harbour, and through a tunnel under one of the
hills to what was intended to be a breakwater, but is now
a sort of pier, at which no vessels ever lie, becoming, therefore,
only a place people stroll to in moderately calm
weather, to watch the waves dashing upon and over the
rocks in wild beauty. In rough weather no one dare
venture. From this pier the road winds back towards the
town and southward round the Port-Vieux, and through a
gap in the rocks to the sandy Basque beach, which extends
away southward for miles, the rocks rising perpendicularly
from it, perhaps 80 feet high, the curve of the rocks forming
the south bay. From any of the heights about the
Port-Vieux or the Basque, one can see along the coast
20 miles to the entrance of the Bidassoa (the boundary
there between France and Spain), and then on from that
to the coast-line of Spanish mountains (offering a strong
barrier against the aggression of the sea) for at least 40
miles farther, some even saying, though I should doubt it,
seen 100 miles altogether. Southward the range of the
Pyrenees bounds the horizon, the eye being caught by the
Trois Couronnes or three-cornered or peaked mountain,
rising boldly as commander of this battalion of the great
guardian mountain chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>The town of Biarritz bears every mark of its rapid construction.
The streets are very irregular, the houses having
been placed just any way and according to any plan, at the
mere caprice of the builders. One leading street, lined by
trees, passes through it to the Port-Vieux. In the centre
of the town this widens to what may be called a large
square or place, whence the omnibuses or diligences start,
and where carriages can be had for hire. The Hotel de
Ville has been built at one end of this place, which, in the
height of the season, must be full of life. The principal
shops are in its neighbourhood, some of them exhibiting
in their windows articles of lace worn by the Spanish
ladies, and Spanish shawls, sword-sticks, stilettoes, as well
as other things of a more agreeable use. Itinerant vendors,
too, of Spanish goods are always going about during the
season, sometimes gaily dressed in a sort of showy fancy
Spanish costume; but when the summer season is over,
they migrate to Pau, and even to Cannes, Mentone, and
other winter-season places, where we frequently saw the
same men and women so occupied we had previously
noticed at Biarritz. Some shopkeepers from Nice open
establishments during the season at Biarritz, and close them
when it is over. Besides many good shops, there is a
regular market, though of small size. The town covers a
considerable extent of ground, and new houses are being
constantly built. The ordinary population now exceeds
4000. The English church had been found too small for
its occupants, and a large new one was, while we were
there, in course of completion.</p>

<p>Many nice-looking villas have been planted on the outskirts
of the town, particularly upon and in the direction
of the road to Bayonne. The heights above the Basque
beach are likewise studded by various distinctive houses;
and about a mile from town, isolated from everything about,
there is a house belonging to Lord Ernest Bruce, built in the
Moorish style with a glass dome, and surrounded by a garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>The French and Spanish form the bulk of the visitors
during August and September, these months constituting,
<i>par excellence</i>, what is called the season, while during the
winter months the English take possession. In the winter
months the hotel charges undergo great modification, and
<i>pension</i> can then be had in some of the best hotels at 7
francs per day.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It is noteworthy that <i>pension</i> at Biarritz
and Pau, and elsewhere in the south of France, includes
wine. House accommodation, too, in the winter months
is correspondingly cheap. The best months for enjoying
Biarritz, we were informed, are the months of April and
May, when the heat is sufficient but not oppressive. The
month of July is sometimes unbearably hot. A family who
had been there during July told us that they could hardly
venture out in that month till late in the evening; and if
the sirocco prevailed, they were even obliged to close the
windows, the hot sand percolating through every crevice.
The band of music, I understood, plays only during the two
months of the season, and removes at its close, when the
enclosure is dismantled.</p>

<p class="p2">But the great attractions of Biarritz consist in its beach,
its rocks, its grand seas, and in its capacities for good
bathing. We were never fortunate enough to witness a
storm in the bay, although there was occasionally enough
of swell upon the water to show what a storm could be.
Our landlord, speaking of the appearance of a storm on the
ocean, described it as ‘terreeble;’ and no doubt it is, and
not very safe, too, as sometimes people are washed away by
an unexpected dash and sweep of the ocean. But a standing
evidence of the force of the waves is exhibited by the
remains or ruins of the breakwater, begun in view of here
affording a port of refuge and pier. Regarding this scheme
Count Russell says (p. 13):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Napoleon <span class="smcap">III.</span> suggested it, meaning to connect by a breakwater several
of the detached rocks scattered on the north-western side of the Porte Vieux,
and thus to form a small harbour, only open to the north. A clever
engineer, M. Palaà, was entrusted with this almost superhuman undertaking,
but the only result has been, after years of labour and more than
one sacrifice of life, to accumulate a shapeless and useless mass of ruins
along the intended harbour. The breakwater (or what is left of it) was built
with concrete; artificial square blocks weighing 36 tons (some of them 48)
were sunk by hundreds at random and just where they liked to fall! But
the tremendous surf has been playing with them as if they were pebbles, and
in 1868 one of them was carried right over the pier (22 feet above low-water
mark) like a toy or a feather! For these and for financial reasons the works
are now suspended. They have already cost £120,000, and all to no purpose.
In fact, nothing human can resist such a sea as the Sea of Biscay, except,
perhaps, at St. Jean de Luz, where nature has half made a harbour.’</p>

<p class="p1">The sea is by far too treacherous and violent to make
boating safe, and we seldom, if ever, saw pleasure-boats out,
although they were lying in the harbour.</p>

<p>Some isolated rocks stand out in the water, separated
from the mainland, with which, I fancy, they have at one
time been connected. They are rough, and rugged, and
bare, and honeycombed, and even, occasionally, altogether
perforated by the water; bearing witness in their haggard
condition to the violence of the waves by which they are
continually assailed, undermined, broken up, and thrown
down. It is, indeed, very beautiful to see, during a swell,
the water lashing the rocks and dashing over in clouds
of white spray, or sometimes through the perforations or
over and down the rocks in streams of white foam. During
the day we used to stand and observe the swell surging
into the large cavities formed by continual action, and
tossed out again, as if the rocks had said with Phineas,
‘Friend, thee isn’t wanted here;’ while the whole water
around, nothing daunted, was boiling and excited, dancing
and glancing and sparkling in the sun as if in glee, or in
the spirit of fun and mischief. This, too, in calm weather.
But at night we used to hear the boom of the waves as
they tumbled into these caverns and were as promptly
turned out again, as if it had been guns firing&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
which, indeed, at first we were inclined to mistake the
sound.</p>

<p>Unlike the Mediterranean Sea, the tide has the usual ebb
and flow of the Atlantic, consequently not only is the
beach more interesting, but the town is kept more healthy.
The sands afford the usual occupation and delight to
children, but shells and seaweed are rare. A good many
jelly-fish are thrown up; some gelatinous animals of a large
size perhaps were octopi. We used often to sit by the
beach and watch the sea, especially under the Basque
Rocks, where the waves, with the slightest breath of wind,
would come charging gallantly in, high and crested, and
turn gracefully over in long lines when they neared the
shore. Over the rocks the inhabitants would seem to have
the odious habit of running their drains or dirty water,
both unsightly to the eye and leaving disagreeable black
pools below. This surely might be remedied. It does
create a drawback to this most enjoyable beach. Equally
objectionable, if not more so, is the practice, so offensive at
Cannes, of putting the outlets of the town drains close to
each of the bathing-places. The tide, no doubt, is such at
Biarritz as to remove the stuff carried down, but there
could or should be no difficulty in carrying the pipes away
to some distance from parts where people enter the water
to bathe, and at all events in not making them so obnoxiously
near and prominent.</p>

<p class="p2">There are three bathing establishments at Biarritz.
One, and the largest, is on the Grande Plage, between the
Villa Eugenie and the hotels, though much closer to the
latter. It is a large wooden building of one storey, in the
Moorish style, and opening from the promenade, three or
four steps leading down at each end to the sands. When
the tide is low there is a long space of sand to traverse.
At the west side, where the rocks are, a rope for the use
of the bathers is stretched between two rocks running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
seaward. The second is on the Port-Vieux, a creek
perhaps 400 or 500 feet long by 100 to 150 feet wide.
The wooden building forming the bathing establishment,
of very neat design, with a balcony running all round, and
a red-tiled roof, is built on three sides of the square down
to the usual high-water mark. The fourth and open side
is to the sea, which for a good way out is hemmed in by
rocks, between which a rope, slack but strong, is stretched
across the creek, hanging, in very low tide, considerably
above water, but in high tide having the middle part
submerged. One side of the house is devoted to the
dressing-rooms of the ladies and the other to those of the
gentlemen, and long wooden stairs on each side enable the
bathers to reach the sands. A few yards brings into
sufficient depth for bathing, but at low water the sea goes
back so as to land one among the rocks, especially in
spring tides, and bathing is then not so pleasant, especially
to non-swimmers; but this condition does not last above
an hour. When the wind is in the west, even when
hardly perceptible, there is more or less surf at the edge,
and in strong west or north-west winds the swell must be
such as to prevent bathing altogether at the Port-Vieux.
But in this case more shelter will no doubt be had at the
Grande Plage, which is to a small extent protected on the
west by rocks. In stormy weather it must be altogether
impossible to bathe anywhere. The third bathing
establishment is at (though raised some feet above) the
Basque beach, and is intended for the convenience of those
residing in that neighbourhood on the plateau above. It is
smaller considerably than either of the other two, and can be
reached from the sands by ascending a ladder or stair of
steps, or from the town by descending a zigzag path from
the top of the nearly perpendicular rock against which it
is placed. The arrangements of all are, I suppose, on
exactly the same principles: little boxes under cover of
the establishment for undressing and dressing, towels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the usual appliances, including a tub of hot water to take
the sand out of the feet.</p>

<p>The establishment at the Grande Plage is much the
largest, but we always gave the preference to the Port-Vieux,
where the Empress formerly used to sit and watch
the bathers if she did not bathe herself. The town and
road are high above it, and descending by a handsome stone
staircase, one is confronted at the bottom by the ticket
office, where (those not bathing can without charge go down
to the beach) those intending to bathe pay according to their
requirements, usually from half a franc to a franc each,
the assistance of a bathing man being charged half a franc
additional. No gratuities are expected, but a box at the
dressing-room entrance-door modestly appears, into which
those who choose may in passing drop a coin now and
then. Bathers can be supplied with a bathing dress, and
have it washed, but most people naturally prefer to have
their own habiliments.</p>

<p class="p2">Bathing is the great occupation of the visitors. Many
bathe twice a day, and some, I believe, all the year round,
wind and weather permitting. The sea is full of saline
particles, and is usually warm, while the atmosphere is also
warm and salubrious, so that bathing is even advantageous
to those who dare not venture on it in the British Isles.
Unless the wind be blowing, say, from the north-west, it is
almost always possible to obtain a dip. To call a bathe
there a dip, however, would be exceedingly inappropriate.
It is a steady, serious occupation of some duration, and
more or less protracted according to the heat of the
weather and the enthusiasm of the bather. The times for
bathing are in the morning before breakfast, after breakfast
between ten and twelve, and in the afternoon between
three and six. During the bathing hours spectators in
crowds, perhaps not so numerous and certainly not so
noisy as at Ramsgate on a forenoon, but stationed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
every available point, or quietly standing or sitting on
rocks, sands, or chairs, or on the steps or balconies of the
establishments, amusedly watch the performances, which
are extremely interesting, and to British eyes peculiar. At
the Port-Vieux special vantage-ground is gained by the
road, which, like a gallery, envelopes the three sides, and
being higher than the roof of the building, enables the
passers-by to peer down from perhaps 50 feet above on
the aquatic sport below.</p>

<p>For ladies and gentlemen array themselves in bathing
costume, in which they march down to the water from the
establishment&mdash;the ladies in general wearing over all a
cloak or shawl, which they drop ere they reach the edge,
and it is taken charge of by a friend or a bathing man.
The ladies’ habit, of which the fanciful patterns (possibly
imagined and engraved in far-away Paris) exhibited in
dressmakers’ shop windows afford but a faint and incorrect
idea (as, for example, in representing ladies appearing in
lace frills, and trig, tight, little laced boots), usually consists
of a short tunic with equally short sleeves, not reaching to
the elbows, and knee-breeches reaching barely to the knees,
the tunic girt at the waste by a girdle, to which is attached
in the majority of cases, <i>à la</i> John Gilpin, two empty yellow
gourds as floats. Then very often a straw hat is stuck upon
the head, and tied by a ribbon over the crown and broad
brim and under the chin, giving the appearance of a frightful
‘ugly;’ while on the feet are generally worn a pair of local
shoes made of canvas, with thick hemp soles, which,
decorated with devices in worsted, are very commonly worn
by the residents, and even for walking about the beach by
many of the visitors, and are sold for 2 or 3 francs per
pair. The bathing dresses vary in pattern and shape, and
are of all colours. White is seldom worn. Bright colours&mdash;red,
scarlet, green, light blue, yellow, amber&mdash;are often
seen; in short, the aim with many is apparently at something
stunning, suitable for the adornment of a pretty
mermaid. To add to the effect, smart young ladies will
also have their dresses embroidered, and otherwise made
attractive and bewitching, in the way only a graceful girl
knows how; and really it must be confessed that this
bloomer costume is exceedingly becoming, at all events to
the younger ladies. Stout old ladies cut a figure in it
sometimes remarkable.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentlemen, on the other hand, look like harlequins,
for their costume in general consists of a somewhat tight-fitting
dress either of cotton or woollen, and most commonly
in stripes of two colours, and of all colours and shades,
though white and blue stripes are the most common. Their
dress costs from 6f. to 20f. (a very good woollen one in
red and black stripes cost me 13f.). Some of the old
gentlemen wear a straw hat loose on their heads, so that
occasionally it is seen floating away from the wearer by
reason of an accidental wave or submersion. I suppose the
object of the straw hat is to obtain protection against the
beams of the sun, but it suggests the uncomfortable idea
that the wearer never plunges his or her head under water,
the doing of which would, I doubt not, afford equal protection
against the sun’s heat, and is in any view always necessary
to prevent a flow of blood to the brain in bathing.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In these varied and brightly-coloured costumes, the bathers
cut gay figures. But the picture is composed and completed
when they enter into action. At the edge of the
water, the gentlemen bathers, sometimes portly and rotund,
having threaded in bare feet their way down through the
ladies sitting on the stairs, and through the crowd of spectators
on the sand, wait with patience in their brilliant,
tight, and unusual attire, the observed of all observers, the
arrival of their lady friends, if they any have, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
their arrival, taking their hand, accompany them into the
water; or the ladies take the hand of a bathing man engaged
to attend them, and march in under their charge,
and presently they are in the clear salt water, alive with
bathers in every colour and in every form of movement
practised by those who go down to the sea to bathe.
Some rush from the shore wildly and inhumanly into the
water, and, wickedly regardless of frightening the small
fishes, dive head foremost with a splash, and strike out.
Others stalk in majestically, and either quietly push far
out, or paddle about pretending or attempting to swim in
shallow water. Then other gentlemen are giving encouragement
to their little boys or girls, or to their wives, or possibly
their lovers, or improbably their sisters, either dipping
them, or helping them to swim, or teaching them to float,
or joining in other usual maritime gyrations. Others catch
hold of the rope stretched out if the water be low, and dance
about in a mad and profitless way, or if the tide be high,
the swimmers catch at it as they pass and take a rest; and
sometimes, if at a proper height, an adventurous one will
sit upon the rope, like a sparrow on a telegraph wire, when
(perhaps beholding admiringly from the treacherous seat
some fat lady floating on her back on the surface, her
bathing integuments undulating in the water like the tentacular
folds of a jelly-fish) of a sudden somebody else,
perhaps waggishly, perhaps innocently, clutches at the slack
rope, and with unexpected shock upsets the unwary, abstracted
philosopher, who with a whirl capsizes heels in the
air, and head making discoveries through eyegate, nosegate,
and mouthgate in the brine below. Or two recently arrived
English young ladies will walk in, hand in hand, scorning
the aid of a bathing man, and perform together, with all
the regularity of clockwork, an endless series of curtsey
ducks in the water without stirring from the safely selected
spot. Other ladies, to vary the programme, are carried out
by a bathing man and dipped horizontally in the wave, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
that head and feet obtain ablution simultaneously; or a
stout matron will take hold of a bathing man, who swims
out with her on his back apparently, so that she enjoys the
luxury of being buoyed up and drawn through the water,
and can say, ‘I’m afloat.’ But these sham swimmers are
notably the exceptions. The great matter of observation
is that the vast majority of the ladies, young and old, swim
about as easily as the gentlemen, though they are in doing
so generally accompanied by a man swimming behind or
beside them in case of accident; and, indeed, one important
occupation of those employed as bathing men is to teach
the young idea how to swim, an accomplishment which,
after a few lessons, they are usually able to master, and
young girls are constantly seen swimming about among the
others, like minnows among the tritons. Some ladies,
after long practice, are very adventurous; two of them
will go out together in a boat a considerable distance, when,
throwing off their cloaks, they will dive head foremost
from the side of the boat and swim ashore, the boat following.
One little girl was most clever. She would go
out to what looks like the vestige of an old pier, and,
jumping high, perform a somersault, and, diving under the
water, ‘come up smiling,’ swim about, and do it again and
again. I have, however, seen many older diving belles
jumping from the same pier. In fact, bathing in all its
forms is here carried by the ladies to an enviable perfection
altogether unknown at home; and while it not merely
affords a most invigorating exercise, it becomes a most
valuable branch of education, tending to lessen the risk of
casualties at sea. It were well that at home the good
example could be followed.</p>

<p class="p2">The late King of Hanover was at Biarritz while we were
there. Being blind, he was carried into the water upon a
<i>chaise-à-porteur</i> by four men, his suite bathing with him.
His daughter was said to bathe at an early hour in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
morning, and many ladies, we were told, bathed as early
as six o’clock. During the time we were there, and the
weather being cold, forenoon and afternoon were preferable.</p>

<p>The bathing men will never dip one’s head unless expressly
desired to do so, and never propose it&mdash;a great
mistake. The bathing dress is not at all inconvenient or
uncomfortable while in the water, but it is heavy out of it,
especially if of woollen material (decidedly the best kind),
because it absorbs and retains a great deal of water.</p>

<p class="p2">Away from the beach all the walks are on the high
roads, which are principally three,&mdash;to the railway station,
to Bayonne, and to the lighthouse. The distance to the
lighthouse by the road is considerably farther than by the
beach, from which to the platform on the top of the rocks
whereon it stands, access is had by a steep path. From
the top of the lighthouse, 220 feet from the level of the
sea to the lantern, a most extensive view is had northward
up the west coast of France, bordered by the Landes&mdash;a low
sandy coast, now planted with pine trees to guard against the
incursions of the sea&mdash;stretching 100 miles towards Bordeaux;
and in the other direction along the Spanish coast,
bounded by a chain of mountains far as the eye can see;
while inland the view extends towards the Pyrenees. A
steep path leads from the lighthouse to a small recessed
platform half-way down the rock, where in calm weather
one can behold the swelling and surging sea below ever and
anon dashing against the rocks, and where men repair with
long rods and lines to fish. But in stormy weather it is
dangerous even to stand on the ground above; people
are exposed to be swept away by unexpected rushes of the
sea, and many have been drowned there in consequence.
The fish caught at this platform, so far as we know, were
small. Indeed, at Biarritz there are not many caught,
though the table is always supplied from neighbouring
fishing stations. Lobsters, however, seem to be plentiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>The Villa Eugenie, between the lighthouse and the
town, is an object of interest to every one visiting Biarritz.
It is shown to the public on Mondays. Entrance is had by
the west approach, where there is a lodge and large but
not elegant stabling accommodation. The grounds are not
extensive (about thirty acres in all), but sufficient for a
marine residence of the kind; nor do they exhibit much
attention to horticulture, though perhaps it is hardly fair to
judge of them in present circumstances. The house, of
three storeys, commenced in the year 1854, forms three
sides of a square, with an <i>annexe</i> (I presume, offices) on the
east side. It still belongs to the Empress, who, of course,
never occupies it now, and she will not sell or let it.
Ringing the bell, an old servant (who expects a small fee
from each party for his trouble) opens the door and shows
visitors through the house. Our troop consisted of several
distinct parties, mustering probably above a dozen persons
in all. The rooms are of comfortable size, and compose just
what an Empress would consider to be a snuggery. The
dining-room is the largest room in the house, the windows
facing on one side the west to the town and sea, on another
northward to the sea and lighthouse. On a rough guess,
and speaking from recollection, it is probably from 40 to 50
feet long and from 20 to 25 feet wide, the ceiling lofty.
The reception-room is comparatively small. The bedrooms
of the Emperor, Empress, and Prince are just of a comfortable
size. There are many small bedrooms, very nicely
decorated, for use of the suite or for visitors. The floors are
polished, and the staircase is so slippery that people are
cautioned to take great care in descending, the steps not
being carpeted. It was melancholy to think it was no
longer possible for poor Eugenie to occupy this delightful
residence.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Perhaps it is the only place in France where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the Imperial arms remain, and one sees upon it also the
touching monogram <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25em; padding-right: 0.25em;">ƎNE</span>, which reads up or down. The
place would to our Queen be objectionable as being so
close to a town; but to a French lady this, no doubt,
would give it additional attraction, and it must be recollected
that Biarritz in reality largely owes its existence to the
Empress having built her villa there. For this the French
people should be grateful, although it looks a little unlike
it, because in the grounds two pillars in front of a small
unfinished chapel for the Imperial family use have been
much broken. This, however, may merely have been the
result of accident.</p>

<p class="p2">It is a pleasant drive to Bayonne, which lies about five
miles off. Like many other roads in France, such as at Pau,
the road proceeds a long way in a straight line, flanked
by regimental rows of trees, which, affording shade from
the sun, have a peculiarly stiff effect. Here, as elsewhere,
too, contrary to the Roman beau-ideal of a road that it
should be level, this one, though straight, yields to the inequalities
of the ground, and is alternately in hollows and
on elevations. But people ought to be thankful the road is
so good, for, speaking of a time about forty years ago or
more, Dr. Taylor (<i>Climate of Pau</i>) says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘There was no carriage road from Bayonne to Biarritz, the only conveyance
being <i>en cacolet</i>, which contrivance consisted of a pair of panniers laid on the
back of a horse or mule, into each of which a traveller of equal weight, if
possible, had to perch himself at the same instant with his fellow, and to preserve
their position as best they could. In the event of one being lighter
than the other, there was a make-weight of stones put along with him in the
pannier to adjust the equilibrium.’</p>

<p class="p1">Judging from the specimens of comfortable Spanish ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
we saw at Biarritz, I should pity the horse or the mule
which had to carry two of them.</p>

<p>About half way to Biarritz, a very elegant white stone
villa in the Moorish style is passed&mdash;the Villa Sophia.
There is something very unique in the appearance of this
building, which is covered with arabesques, inducing me
to go out one day and take a rough sketch of it. On
approaching Bayonne, the road lies through a wood&mdash;I
suppose, a suburban park. Then on entering the town we
see a long many-arched stone bridge spanning the Adour,&mdash;here
very wide,&mdash;and beyond it the fortifications, built by
Vauban. These may at one time have been considered
strong, but at the present day cannot be thought so, and
they are overlooked by neighbouring heights. The fort lacks
the picturesquely-imposing appearance of stone wall castles.
A good deal of historical interest attaches to Bayonne and
its fortifications. The town itself is not remarkable for
much save its four bridges, crossing very close to each
other the river Nive, which here joins the Adour. The
cathedral, above seven hundred years old, is large and handsome,
and is in course of restoration. The spires (one of
them only is completed, the other being in course of completion)
are very beautiful, tapering gradually, with spirelets
around; but the church is like too many others abroad,
rather hemmed in by the houses around.</p>

<p class="p2">There are other good drives about Biarritz, and particularly
to the Bois de Boulogne and to the old historical maritime
town of St. Jean de Luz, about ten miles distant, and not
far from the Spanish border. It was here Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> had a
residence and was married. His house, in the French style,
with square towers at the four corners, stands now in the
centre of the town upon the main street, and in its ground
floor is occupied with shops and cafés. St. Jean is also a
bathing place, but is not so popular, and is certainly not so
attractive, as Biarritz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a fine drive to Cambo, at the base of the
Pyrenees, but during the first part of the period of our stay
at Biarritz the weather was too cold to take it, and in the
latter part the days were getting rather too short, the distance
being about eighteen miles.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Few people visit Biarritz without making an excursion by
railway to St. Sebastian to see a little of Spain. It is thirty-seven
miles distant by rail, and can be easily managed in a
day&mdash;in fact, going by morning train, one is left rather too
much time in St. Sebastian. Crossing the river Bidassoa, the
picturesque town of Fuenterrabia is the first object catching
the eye on the Spanish border. A halt of an hour is made
at Irun for examination of the luggage, and it is possible,
though a risk, to drive off and return in time for the train
after a hurried examination of this interesting old town,
which from the railway has an appearance of being deserted.
Leaving Irun, the railway winds its way through the mountains,
and reaches St. Sebastian, which is a tidy-looking
town standing at the mouth of a river crossed by a handsome
bridge, with view out to the Bay of Biscay and to
the fortress of St. Sebastian on a hill next the sea. The
town lies on the landward side of this hill, the more
modern part of it, at least, consisting of wide streets and
lofty square houses with nothing redeeming about their
aspect. Passing along the main wide street from the bridge,
we arrive at an enclosed natural harbour, a tract of sea,
like a bag contracted at the neck, through which communication
is had with the bay without. The shipping is not
extensive; the harbour proper, lying on the side nearest
the sea, being small. On the south side, next the newer
portion of the town and the railway, the grand <i>plage</i>
bathing-place, with a wooden bathing-house, is found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Behind it the mountains rise picturesquely. It requires
an order to see the fortress, which is mainly of earthen
ramparts. The town itself has little of interest in it. Close
by the railway station, however, there is a very large wooden
amphitheatre for bull-fights. Bills containing announcements
of one of these savage entertainments were placarded
on the building and the railway stations and elsewhere.
The dwellings on the line of railway are similar to those
about Biarritz, principally of the Basque style; many of
them have on the top little glazed houses, sort of huts, no
doubt designated, according to the taste of the occupants,
as observatories, retreats, or smoking-rooms. Except for
seeing a little of Spain, I believe it is better rather to stop
and see the curious old town of Fuenterrabia.</p>

<p class="p2">After 1st October a very marked change came over the
appearance of Biarritz. Nearly all of the Spanish and
French visitors (coming no doubt for the gaiety) then left,
while the English influx for the winter season had scarcely
begun. During the first fortnight of this month the town
wore a deserted look, and this was greatly aggravated by
many of the shops commencing to pack up for migration
to other places, and one after another closing. I daresay, a
month later, there would be more life in the place.</p>

<p class="p2">We had all experienced the greatest benefit from our
short residence of about a month in Biarritz, and although
the weather was, during the greater part of the time,
especially at first, very cold, in consequence of the northeasterly
winds, we felt that our invalid especially had
derived great good from the ‘soothing and invigorating air;’
so much so that we fondly thought, owing to this and the
former changes, she was now in recovered health, and that
it only wanted another winter in the Riviera to set her
completely up. Biarritz is considered too cold a place for
delicate persons to winter in, and the approach of its winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
season would in any view have warned us away. But we
did feel extremely reluctant to leave; for this agreeable
watering-place had quite taken our fancy, and perhaps we
felt the leaving all the more that we had not seen it in its
stern grandeur of a storm, or even in its wild grandeur of
a cloudy sunset, while, under the influence of a gentle wind
blowing from the south, the day upon which we left was
one of the finest and sunniest we had had while there.
Having a good hour before departure, we visited all the
beaches and rocks, and lingered sorrowfully upon the scenes
now so radiant in sunshine and so genial in their warmth,
where we had spent pleasant times, and thence looked out
upon the bright sparkling ocean gleaming below us, and the
waves gently kissing the shore and bidding us adieu, and
with unwilling steps returned to our hotel to leave for
Pau. This leave-taking is one of the penalties to be paid
for the pleasure of travelling in bright spots where everything
has combined to make one happy&mdash;where the scenes
are new and pleasing, where the object of travel seems to
have been secured, and where hearts in perfect harmony
and with congenial likings are able to appreciate the blessings
they have thus been privileged together to enjoy.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch"><i>PAU.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Engaging</span> a small omnibus for 8 francs to Bayonne, five
miles distant, we left Biarritz at 12.25 for the 1.45 train
to Pau. The station at Bayonne for Pau in one direction,
and Bordeaux in another, is on the north side of the Adour,
so that we had to cross the long bridge over that river.
The day was glorious, and the Adour, by whose banks we
proceeded part of the way, was looking very fine.</p>

<p class="p2">The traveller arrives at Pau by railway, in a station
down in the depths on the banks of the river Gave, a
tributary of the Adour. But the town itself mainly lies on
a level platform, about 150 feet higher, and almost immediately
above, the rise being sharp, and the road whereby
it is reached very steep. The best advantage has been
taken of the situation to erect in front line a series of
imposing edifices near to the edge of this almost perpendicular
height, so that on issuing from the railway station
the <i>coup d’&oelig;il</i> is extremely impressive. Commencing at the
west end, the chateau or castle, with its ivy-clad old tower
or donjon, is the first object arresting the attention&mdash;a large
symmetrical building in the chateau style. Then the eye
runs along to the great new Hotel Gassion, with its corner
projections (which are neither towers nor turrets), surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
by clumsy extinguisher pointed roofs, and then
the white Church of St. Martin’s, with its lofty graceful
needle spire, and on to the Hotel de France and other
imposing houses in the Place Royale&mdash;the whole producing
an effect which gives to the stranger the idea of a magnificent
city behind. But the truth is (all honour to those
who did it), that the grenadiers have here all been brought
to the front rank; for the stately group assembles in this
commanding spot nearly all the buildings which are noteworthy
in Pau, the only other, if I am not mistaken,
being the white Church of St. Jacques, with its fine double
spires, and perhaps the adjoining Palais de Justice, both at
a little distance from the Place Royale.</p>

<p class="p2">We had been recommended on our first visit to apply for
quarters at the Pension Colbert, near the termination of
the Rue Montpensier, at the north or rural side of the
town, kept by English ladies (Misses Finch). It was at
first a steep pull up the hill for the horses, but the hill
conquered, the road was thereafter level. We had been
made not merely so comfortable, but so much at home, at
this house that we engaged rooms in it on our return from
Biarritz. On our first visit in September, it was before the
season commenced, and we were accordingly the only
guests; on the second, the house was nearly full, and we
experienced similar kind attention. It is recommended,
with a view to getting gradually accustomed to the climate
before winter sets in, that invalids should come in September,
and there seems no reason in the shape of excessive
heat or the presence of mosquitoes to prevent it; the
weather, indeed, was cool during our first visit. But the
season does not really begin before the end of October, and
it is even the first week of November before Pau becomes
tolerably full. We accordingly found it upon our second
visit, in the middle of October, still comparatively empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>The climate of Pau is not what suits every one. As
compared with Biarritz in the months from October to
March inclusive, the mean temperature is, according to the
month, from one to five degrees lower. Whether it was
owing to our experiencing a difference of temperature, or to
the fact of our having had a good deal of rain while in Pau,
or whether due to accidental circumstances, such as neglect
to shut a bedroom window one evening, we all caught colds
there, and lost much of the good we had got at Biarritz.
The fact suggests some notice of what has been said on the
subject of the climate of Pau as a health resort.</p>

<p>Dr., afterwards Sir Alexander Taylor, who wrote a special
book on the climate of Pau and other places,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> divides
climates into three classes: <i>exciting</i>, <i>sedative</i>, and <i>relaxing</i>,
and he gives us examples (p. 21)&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Of exciting climates&mdash;Nice, Naples, Montpellier, and
Florence.</p>

<p>2. Of sedative climates&mdash;Rome and, <i>par excellence</i>, Pau.</p>

<p>3. Of relaxing climates&mdash;Pisa and Madeira.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘In the sedative climate we have a more neutral state of the atmosphere&mdash;a
remarkable freedom from dryness on the one hand, and from communicable
humidity on the other, and in Pau particularly, great stillness of the
atmosphere.’</p>

<p class="p1">It is therefore only in cases where a sedative climate
would be beneficial that Dr. Taylor recommends Pau,
and in a subsequent chapter (p. 100) he mentions the
kind of cases for which the climate of Pau is specially
beneficial.</p>

<p>Among the characteristics of the climate, he mentions
that while more rain falls in Pau than in London and some
other situations in England, yet from the absorbent nature
of the soil, and from some peculiar electric state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
atmosphere, there is an absence of ‘free communicable
humidity;’ and that while 27 inches of rain fall annually
in London, and from 40 to 50 inches in Pau, the number
of rainy days is only 109 against 178 in London. Further,
a very important advantage possessed by Pau is its distinguishing
freedom from wind from apparently any quarter,
while the malevolent circius, bise, and the mistral are never
felt there. Dr. Taylor contrasts in tables the difference of
temperature between Greenwich and Pau&mdash;as, for example,
in the mean temperature of each for the months between
October and May, showing them to vary, according to the
month, from 3 to 7 degrees in favour of Pau. The mean
moisture of the air is also shown to be generally about
one-twelfth less at Pau; while a further circumstance is
that there is more sunshine at Pau, imparting greater cheerfulness
to the winter climate. A very curious additional
fact is thus stated (p. 80):&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘From an examination of the mean distribution of the winds, according
to the cardinal points of the compass, indicated by carefully-kept registers
for a considerable series of years, we find that they show northerly winds
prevailed in summer, southerly in winter, easterly in autumn and winter,
and westerly in spring and early summer; and when we recall to the reader
what has before been said with regard to the usual want of force of the winds
at all times at Pau, he can easily figure to himself how the heats of summer
being modified by the northerly wind, the cold of winter shorn of its intensity
by the southerly, and the usual biting keenness of spring softened by
the prevalence of westerly winds, the climate should act beneficially on the
irritable air passages and on the lungs of invalids either predisposed to active
disease or which are already a prey to it.’</p>

<p class="p1">At another place Dr. Taylor gives a table of death-rates,
from which Pau would seem to be at the top of the list
for least mortality&mdash;as, for example, while in Pau 1 in
45 died annually, in London it was 1 in 40, in Nice 1 in
31, Rome 1 in 25, Vienna 1 in 22½, etc.; and he adds
this important statement (p. 94):&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘In the department of the Basses Pyrénées, in a period of seventeen years,
1777 persons died from 90 to 95, 649 from 95 to 100, and 168 above 100
years of age. In Pau itself, during a period of twenty years, 390 persons died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
from 80 to 85, 161 from 85 to 90, and 103 from 90 to 100 and upwards. By
the last census, there were in Pau several persons ranging from 100 to 104
years of age, and in the department also several <i>centenaires</i> who are described
as being still very healthy.’</p>

<p class="p1">But I must refer to Dr. Taylor’s work for more information
on this and other matters relating to Pau. Besides
containing general information relative to the town itself, it
deals in its last half with the climate of other places, and
particularly affords information relative to the different
places of resort in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Another book (already referred to, p. 53), by Dr. Frederick
H. Johnson, entitled, <i>A Winter’s Sketches in the South of
France and the Pyrenees</i>, is similarly devoted to Pau and the
Pyrenees, and is written in an interesting, graphic manner.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Home Douglas, in his little work called <i>Searches
for Summer</i>, takes a rather different view of the climate of
Pau from Dr. Taylor, although opening his observations by
saying:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Passing from Biarritz to Pau, as we did in the beginning of May, seemed
almost like returning to the still sunny climate of the south of Spain. The
fresh strong Atlantic breeze&mdash;invigorating, doubtless, to many constitutions&mdash;gave
place to such gentle and balmy air as we used to open our windows to
at Malaga.’</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Douglas, not confining comparison to London, compares
the temperature of Pau with that also of other places in
Great Britain, showing that the sunny temperature of Pau
is 4°·1 below that of Helstone in Cornwall, and is under
that of Torquay in Devonshire and Valentia in Ireland
during the same winter months, and quotes Dr. Otley to
the effect that there is greater daily range of temperature
at Pau than in England, adding that the nights must be
colder at Pau than in the west coasts of Britain, and
expresses the opinion that ‘no one who cannot stand
severe cold ought to think of going to Pau for the winter;
better go to Easdale in Argyllshire. No one so constituted
should think of going till March at soonest; April, in my
opinion, is early enough.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Douglas writes as a meteorologist, and his little
volume is a valuable contribution to the consideration of
the temperature of the various places of health resort
therein mentioned; but the facts stated by Dr. Taylor,
even though one is inclined to look with suspicion on
medical advocates of special places, show that the value
of a place for an invalid may not wholly depend on the
records of the thermometer.</p>

<p class="p2">We made Pau only a halting-place for nine days, <i>en
route</i> for the Riviera, and to form some opinion as to its
suitability for a longer stay at another time. Coming from
the ever-changing ocean, and from Biarritz, which had so
captivated our fancy, perhaps we did not take so kindly to
Pau, a large inland rural town, as we might otherwise have
done; while, in consequence of the season not having fairly
commenced, the strangers encountered in the streets were
few, and the town consequently was more dull than it would
have been later on. The weather also was such that we
had not much opportunity of seeing the environs.</p>

<p class="p2">Before 1840, Pau apparently was a place of no repute.
I presume Dr. Taylor’s recommendation gave it its great
stimulus. But in twenty years after 1840 it had largely
increased, evidences of which were, that the octroi duty
had in 1860 realized nearly double, that the British
visitors had amounted to 1000 in number in the year, and
that its population had augmented to 21,000. It has gone
on increasing since, and is now so well frequented as to
require no less than three English churches and one Scotch
church, with resident ministers, while the population is
reckoned to amount to 30,000.</p>

<p>The town itself is regularly built, with good leading
streets, and possesses a large market-place, where goods of
all kinds, even broadcloths, are sold in open stalls; and as
Pau is the centre of a very large rural population, it is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
market days a busy place; but there are many good shops
in some of the best streets, and the wares are, I think,
cheaper than in Nice and elsewhere in the Riviera. The
two town churches, St. Martin’s and St. Jacques, are new
and of white stone, and with their fine tapering spires are
externally handsome, but internally, except for their stained-glass
windows, want the richness of ornamentation we had
seen in so many other Roman Catholic churches abroad.</p>

<p class="p2">The grand sight at Pau is the chain of the Pyrenees.
We had only to go a short way along the country road, in
which the Pension Colbert is, to see them. But a more
uninterrupted prospect is had from the Boulevard du Midi,
or terrace of the Place Royale, in front of the prominent
buildings I have already mentioned. Leaning upon
the parapet wall of this fine terrace, and looking almost
straight down upon the valley below, one sees beyond the
road and a small outlying portion of the town and the
railway station, the river Gave flowing sluggishly along,
crossed by a handsome low stone bridge of, I think, five
arches, and lined on both sides by rows of tall poplar and
other trees, and bordered by straggling houses, which give
some character to the scene. Then, on the other side, there
rises a range of well-wooded knolls and hills, called the
Côteaux of Juraçon and Gelos, the highest about 300 feet
in height, and dotted over among the trees by mansions;
and then apparently the ground dips behind them, and in
the distance (the nearest being twenty miles off) the long
range of the Pyrenees stretches out in a continuous line
eastward and westward as far as the eye can see, and
forming the natural boundary and barrier between the two
great countries France and Spain. Rising abruptly and
prominently out of the range like two great tusks, are the
Pic de Midi d’Ossau, to appearance nearly opposite Pau,
and the grandest of the Pyrenees; and away to the eastward,
the Pic de Gers; while still farther to the east, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
eclipsed by intervening heights scarcely visible from Pau,
the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, each of them, or at least the
first and last mentioned, from 10,000 to 11,000 feet high.
From the upper windows of the hotels on this Boulevard
the view must be magnificent. It was very fine from the
windows of the Chateau, but they are of a low elevation.
This view, perhaps the finest in France, is really the great
attraction to the hotels in this quarter, for nowhere else
does it seem possible to obtain the prospect from so high
a position, and so free from intervening obstructions.
When we were at Pau, there was no snow upon the Pyrenees,
so that we failed to see them in their best. Even, however,
when snow-covered, they cannot bear comparison with the
Alps as seen from Turin. But the view may be finer when
the mountains are snow-covered and there is a grand sunset,
for which Pau is famed. The mountains in the ruddy
glow may then resemble the Bernese Alps, as seen from
Berne in a brilliant sunset. At Turin, as the mountains
lie to the west of the town, the sunset effect must be
greatly lost.</p>

<p class="p2">The Chateau, which was the residence of the Princes of
Bearne in former times, and where Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of France was
born in 1553, is well worthy of inspection, and, of course,
any stranger coming to Pau pays it a visit. Three bridges
connect it with the town, and at one time it was doubtless
a place of strength. Entering on one side through what
appears to be a modern screen of three open slender arches
embellished by carved work (seemingly rather too delicate
for a warlike place), and passing the sentinel, the visitor is
at once in the court-yard, the remaining three sides of the
nearly square yard forming the castle, pierced by decorated
windows. The walls are of great thickness, giving the idea
of massive strength and solidity. In some of the rooms
the walls are covered with tapestry, and in parts the
tapestry is a close imitation in worsted of paintings in oil&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
mistake in art, I think. The ceilings are bold in design,
without being either fine or remarkable. The old beds are
curious high boxes of carved oak, requiring steps to enable
the occupants to get up into them. A lower modern carved
bed in one of the rooms, devoid of the canopy of the old
ones, seemed vastly preferable. One of the bedrooms was
hung with silk of the time of Madame de Maintenon, and,
as we understood, manufactured under her superintendence.
The most interesting object in the castle was the cradle
of Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, made of a large tortoise shell. There is a
statue of the great monarch in the grounds, and in the
country round about places exist with which he was
associated; and, indeed, Pau and its neighbourhood is a place
of great historical interest.</p>

<p>A public park closely adjoins the Chateau. It is filled
with lofty trees, and continues for a long stretch by the
banks of the Gave on a rising ground, through which and
under the trees walks have been formed and seats placed,
whence charming views of the river and mountains are had.
The band plays during the season sometimes in the park
and at other times in the Place Royale.</p>

<p class="p2">The environs of Pau are said to be beautiful, but we had
not much opportunity of exploring them. Mr. Inglis (the
traveller), in a passage quoted by Dr. Taylor, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘The Gave serpentines through the charming undulating country that
surrounds the town. Grain, meadows, and vines diversify the scenery, and
innumerable country-houses are everywhere scattered around. Nothing
can exceed the beauty of the promenades in the neighbourhood of Pau.
Some lie alongside the Gave, others along the banks of the smaller river.’</p>

<p class="p1">The road to Bordeaux and the other roads out of Pau
seem to be all lined with regimental rows of poplars,
shady perhaps in sunshine, but stiff. Some neat villas in
nicely-planted gardens in the outskirts of the town&mdash;delightful
retreats&mdash;are let furnished. I had the pleasure
of meeting a very old Scotch friend, who, after having tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
many places, has found the climate of Pau to be most suitable,
and has accordingly built just out of town an elegant villa
for permanent residence.</p>

<p>There are, I believe, many excellent excursions from Pau,
such as a drive to Lourdes, 25 miles distant&mdash;a long day’s
work for the horses there and back, but, I was told and can
readily believe, most enjoyable. In the summer-time, everybody
who can, escapes to the mountains, where so many
charming spots, including Eaux-Chaudes and Eaux-Bonnes,
are to be found.</p>

<p>We paid a visit to the cemetery, which lies back from
the Place d’Armes, and quite out of town, the Protestant
ground being, as customary, separate from the Roman
Catholic. There are throughout many monuments, including
one to Marshal Bosquet, whose name is familiar to us in
connection with the Crimean War. After the war he spent
his last years in Pau, his native place. One monument to
the memory of a Russian lady, representing her in the act
of kneeling and praying, in very rich attire, is of white
marble, and has no doubt been executed in Italy.</p>

<p class="p2">During our stay in Pau, the French General Election
took place, and according to French practice was on a
Sunday (14th October 1877). Everything was quiet,
quieter even than it would have been at home, notwithstanding
it was politically a time of great anxiety.
Although there were some small crowds of people hanging
about the streets on the day of election, and on the following
day the newspaper shops at the time of publishing were
besieged, all was quite orderly. We had it, of course, for
the comfort of the old ladies, that all the Protestants were in
bodily fear; and perhaps in former times there might have
been some risk, for in some parts of France it was an
inconvenient custom, occasionally exercised on a sumptuous
scale, to burn, shoot, and otherwise destroy Protestants and
other obnoxious heretics. In the present day, however, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
would no doubt be considered an economic mistake to slay,
or to drive away to other lands, the birds which beneficently
lay, in hotels, pensions, furnished villas, shops, and other
places, their heart-winning, hate-dissipating golden eggs;
and instead of a display of unpleasant engines of extirpation,
there is great kindliness of feeling towards Protestants,
and every provision is made for alluring strangers to Pau,
and detaining them there by means of cricket and golf
grounds, skating-rinks, fox-hunting, lawn tennis, libraries,
museums, and the like active and passive means of
enjoyment.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>SECOND WINTER IN THE RIVIERA.</i></p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> left Pau for Toulouse on 23d October 1877. The
journey occupied upwards of eight hours, or two hours longer
than the same journey from Toulouse. At every little station
there is a stoppage for an apparently endless length of
time, although I suppose the delay is partly attributable
to the necessities of the careful system of registration of
luggage. One tunnel was shored up, and we went slowly
through it and over the ground before and after. When
we approached Toulouse, and had to cross the rivers, the
train proceeded with the utmost caution. The bridges had
evidently been washed away, and what we passed over
seemed either unfinished or temporary. It was here, it
may be recollected, that in the year 1875 such disastrous
floods took place. But whether the condition of the bridges
in 1877 was attributable to this or to a more recent flooding,
we could not tell. The journey, though long, was
agreeable, the rivers resembling our own Scotch rivers, and
the Pyrenees clear and crisp, with a slight sprinkling or
dusting of snow upon them, though not enough to give
them the aspect of snowy mountains. The trees were
clothed in their autumn tints of yellow, brown, and red,
and the sun was shining. We were accommodated with
the rooms we had formerly occupied in the Hotel Sacaron&mdash;clean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
tidy, but carpetless; the mosquitoes, however,
were gone. A good many persons appeared in the <i>salle à
manger</i>, but there was no common <i>table-d’hôte</i> dinner. Each
party dined separately at 5 francs per head. I had, before
leaving Pau, calculated on getting a good hour before dinner
for a drive through the town; but a change had been recently
made,&mdash;I suppose about the 16th October, the usual commencement
of winter hours,&mdash;by which our train, probably
to dispense with another, became a slow one, stopping at
all stations, and taking two hours longer than before; so
that, arriving at six o’clock, there was no time for a drive
in daylight. In the evening I had a stroll through a small
part of the town, which contains some good wide shop
streets. The Church of St. Servan is the finest, and, according
to representations, peculiarly constructed, but in the
dark I had no opportunity of seeing it. Nor did we see
the bridges and other neighbouring public parts. Had we
not been anxious to push on towards Marseilles, we might
have stopped a day to see a city which has a name, but
is a good deal out of the ordinary path of travellers. We
also missed seeing the view from it of the Pyrenees, which
is said to be there extensive, being about the centre of the
chain. It rained through the night, and was damp in the
morning; and as our train left at ten o’clock, we could
not obtain an hour before leaving for Montpellier.</p>

<p>The scenery between Toulouse and Cette, great part of
which we had missed on our former journey in the dark
or twilight, was not equal to that of the previous day.
We passed field after field of vineyards, where they were
lading large carts with the grapes. About Biarritz and other
places in the south-west of France, the carts are generally
drawn by oxen. In Italy, the equally patient buffalo, with
its meek eyes, is used. Here the carts seen from the railway
were drawn by two horses. Grapes were charged at
the railway station of Narbonne, in the centre of this vine
district, 5d. per lb. We had paid elsewhere from 1½d.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
(15 centimes) to 3d. (30 centimes) per lb., but at railway
stations prices are usually increased. For oranges at railway
stations, 20 centimes apiece were sometimes demanded.
The sun went down as we got into Cette, but not before
gaining, as we approached that port, a glimpse now and then
of our old friend the Mediterranean. A cup of coffee at the
station was refreshing, but the waiter, who calculated in sous,
was very confused in his reckoning. We arrived at Montpellier
in the dark at 6.44, and found the omnibus of the Hotel
Nevet waiting; but it would not start till all luggage was
got out, so that we might as well have taken our luggage with
us instead of leaving it, as we usually did on such journeys,
for the night at the station. This hotel, recommended as
the best, is rather old-fashioned both in accommodation
and furnishing, giving an idea of the comforts enjoyed there
in former times when Montpellier was in vogue, and its
name was a synonym for any place where the air was
peculiarly pure and salubrious. Now I suspect it has
lost favour, and more modern localities, such as Cannes and
Mentone, have supplanted it, as railways have brought their
previously-hidden virtues to light, and rendered them more
easy of access, probably to yield in turn to others better
spoken of. Dr. Taylor (p. 7) thus adverts to its climate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘The climate of the south-east of France, of which Montpellier may be
considered as the centre, is, on the contrary’ (to Pau), ‘highly electric and dry,
subject, particularly during the spring, to severe cutting and irritating winds,
loaded with impalpable dust, exciting in its qualities, and productive of inflammatory
diseases of an acute character. To prove these latter assertions, we
shall produce the following unbiased evidence. We find in a work on the
medical topography of Montpellier, the following statistical results of diseases
treated during a year in the public hospital of that town. The number of
patients admitted in one year was 2756; the proportion of deaths was 154;
and of that number, 53&mdash;that is, more than a third&mdash;were caused by diseases
of the chest. Again, we find the following opinion from a work full of valuable
observations on the effect of the winds of the south-east of France: “One
ought to have a chest sound and well constituted to resist such impressions.”
Matthews also, in his <i>Diary of an Invalid</i>, says “that every mouthful of
the air irritates weak lungs and sets them coughing.”’</p>

<p class="p1">After a late dinner, I walked out, but could see little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
The town seemed full of cafés. In the morning, before
the train started, we had an hour to look about.
It would be unfair to judge of any place with such
slender opportunities, but it did not appear to offer great
attractions. In the centre of the town, surrounded by
lofty buildings, there is a large open place, adorned by a
handsome fountain. Out of this place a Boulevard runs,
leading to the Place d’Armes, where people walk and drive,
and it is said there are fine views of the Pyrenees and Alps
to be had; but the morning was hazy, and any prospect
was hid. It was also cold, and wraps became advisable.</p>

<p>We had to change carriages twice between Montpellier
and Marseilles&mdash;viz., at Tarascon, and again, in little more
than an hour, at Arles. The second change was aggravating,
because we could not see why the carriages might
not have gone on to Marseilles; while those into which,
after some detention and trouble, we were shifted, were
antiquated, narrow, and confined. Fortunately no rain fell
during the change, for Arles station is not under cover.</p>

<p class="p2">I have already, in mentioning our first visit to the
Riviera, taken note of Marseilles. We were glad to meet
some old Scotch friends unexpectedly at the Hotel Noailles.
The weather was cold, which of itself would have rendered
it advisable to push on; so, after a drive through the
town next day, we left for Hyères, about fifty miles distant,
by the 1.20 train, but found by another of those changes
made just a few days previously, we could only book to
Toulon, the train in connection from Toulon to Hyères
by a branch line having been discontinued, although the
Hyères season was just commencing&mdash;a rather odd way of
accommodating the coming visitors. On arrival at Toulon,
we had accordingly upwards of three hours before a train
would start for Hyères, and we availed ourselves of the
time to explore a little about this noted naval station.</p>

<p>The town of Toulon itself is uninteresting; its streets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
dirty and narrow, the houses high. Near the railway
station the ground is more open and the houses more
modern. Passing them, we soon came upon the fortifications
which surround the town, but retracing our steps,
walked down to the docks and along the public quay.
There are two large docks communicating with each other&mdash;the
Port Marchand and the Port Militaire. The latter
is one of the great arsenals of France; but we could
not see it, an order of admission being required, only
procurable in the morning. It extends to 35 acres and is
said to be capable of receiving 200 ships of the line. The
other dock is probably of about the same extent. Both
docks are highly fortified. On looking from the quay, we
saw many of the old men-of-war laid up like invalids, dismasted
and dismantled and put under cover, apparently
as hospital ships. At one time convicts were kept in some
of them. A little beyond, some serviceable men-of-war lay,
and the quays were crowded with boats which, with men
and officers, were passing to and fro, making it a lively, gay
scene. Some civilians were evidently going out in the
boats to see the ships or their friends on board. A bronze
statue has been erected upon the public quay, to the
memory of the many eminent men who have been connected
by birth or otherwise with Toulon and its history,
and whose names are engraved on the sides. After our
stroll, we were glad to return and have, in the railway
station refreshment room, dinner (supplied at 3½ francs a
head, the usual station tariff), and at 6.50 left in the dark
for Hyères, arriving at eight o’clock. Nine omnibuses in a
semicircle were waiting the arrival of the train, but we
were the only passengers requiring conveyance. We took
that of the Hotel d’Orient, recommended in Bradshaw
and also by Murray for its beautiful situation. It is a
comfortable hotel, the hotelkeeper is attentive, and the
situation is more sheltered from the mistral than others;
but it seems a mistake to speak of it as ‘beautiful,’ as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
view it may have commanded at one time is shut out by
the trees of the garden on the opposite side of the road.
The Hotel des Îles d’Or is the principal hotel in Hyères.
It commands a fine view, but has a west or south-west
exposure. The Hesperides Hotel is near to it. This and
the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, in the centre of the small
town, are considered comfortable and more moderate.</p>

<p class="p2">Hyères is considered less costly than any of the other
important places in the Riviera, regarding it as within the
Riviera, which perhaps, strictly speaking, it is not. I believe
it may be considered to be about 2 francs per day less than
Mentone for corresponding accommodation and pension,
and in all probability the reason for this is that it is
not usually thought so attractive. The town itself is
most uninviting. The original and older part of it, lying
upon the hill slope, is so very dirty that I could not bring
myself to visit it a second time. The drains there run
down the middle of the streets, and no regard seems to be
paid to cleanliness. It speaks well, doubtless, for its
healthiness, that the inhabitants can survive its pestilential
odours. The newer part of the town consists mainly of a
long street, in which most of the hotels are, and a few poor
shops, some of which were not, at this early period of the
winter, opened. The Rue des Palmiers, in which the
English church is situated, is the best street. It is flanked
by gardens attached to the houses, and by a row of palm
trees on each side, which grow better in Hyères than they do
in some other parts where they are more exposed to dust and
sea air. This Rue has quite the look of a retired row in
the suburbs of a large city. Outside the town, which is
altogether very small, there are a number of pretty villas.
Behind the town a hill rises steeply to a height of 650 feet,
whereon the château, an old castle, stands. The view from
this hill is very fine, looking down upon the plains below,
and the surrounding mountains, and the Mediterranean three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
miles off&mdash;the long, low, but picturesque islands of Hyères,
called the Îles d’Or, the nearest being to appearance about
two to three miles from the shore, or six miles off, but as
distance on water is deceptive, probably rather more. These
islands, formerly productive, now barren, but said to be
salubrious, are four in number, the largest being four miles
long by two miles broad, and (speaking from distant recollection
of a visit to Ireland) slightly resembling from Hyères,
though larger, Spike Island at Queenstown, Cork.</p>

<p class="p2">There are a number of very nice walks at Hyères.
About a mile out of town, a piece of ground has been
recently laid out as a Jardin d’Acclimation; but as yet it
is mainly occupied by an immense number of ducks of all
kinds. The great drawback to Hyères is, that it is not
sufficiently sheltered from the mistral, which blows during
spring from the west and unprotected side. It is also far
from the sea-shore, and is therefore deprived of the life
and interest always found at the sea-side. Its climate,
though warm, is, I believe, changeable. On the 1st
November it was as hot there as it is any day in July in
London; but it may suit some invalids who require to be
at a distance from the sea. We did not like it, but were
perhaps spoiled for fully appreciating it by having been
previously at other and, as we thought, more attractive
places. This, however, has to be said, that our visit to
Hyères took place before the season had fairly commenced,
and to be in a season place out of season is always dreary.
We were very nearly the only persons in our hotel. There
was one family there, whom we met in very painful
circumstances. They had brought with them a daughter
who had been given up in London by her physicians, who
said her only chance of life was going to the south of France.
With great difficulty she was brought so far. She survived
about five or six weeks from the time of leaving home, but
died a few days after reaching Hyères. We attended her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
funeral, conducted by the English clergyman, and it was
gratifying to see that it created an apparent sympathy
among the native population, who assembled in considerable
numbers in the burying-ground.</p>

<p class="p2">Hyères is no doubt interesting to other persons; indeed,
we have met with those who have spoken very highly of
it. La Plage, the nearest point on the coast, is about three
miles distant, and the railway has been extended to it and
to the salines beyond. We took the train to it one day,
and found a few villas had been built in the hope of
making it a seaside town; but at the time of our visit, at
least, the speculation did not seem to look hopeful. There
is nothing attractive either about the beach or about the
neighbourhood, except a forest of umbrella pines, affording
the only shelter it possesses against the winds, which
must often blow violently at this part, and were blowing so
keenly at the time that we were glad to walk home and not
wait three hours for a train.</p>

<p class="p2">We were a good deal annoyed by mosquitoes while at
Hyères, necessitating recourse to burning pastilles at night,
and waging a war of extermination in the morning.</p>

<p class="p2">After being eight days at Hyères, we were by no means
sorry to leave it for Cannes by the little branch line to
Toulon, where we were doomed to wait two hours&mdash;one
in consequence of the trains not fitting in, and
another because the train we were to join (a first-class
express from Paris) was an hour behind time. French
trains are generally very punctual, but on these long
journeys are, especially at the commencement of a season,
often late. The engine was, in consequence, urged on at
an unusual speed after leaving Toulon, and we had made
up a good part of the lost time when we were stopped at
Fréjus by a goods train having by some accident got in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the way. After all, we were not more than half an hour
late at Cannes. We again had much difficulty in getting
seat-room, guards affording no manner of assistance; the
carriages also were filled with people who had travelled all
night from Paris, and perhaps were selfishly unwilling
to be disturbed by intruders. On this our second journey
to Cannes, the blinds on <i>both</i> sides of the carriage were
ruthlessly closed by the ‘foreigners’ sitting next them, so
that we had no chance of seeing the lovely views to be
had from the windows.</p>

<p>We went to our old quarters at Cannes, where, in spite
of mosquitoes and flies, we were, as before, very comfortable.
The weather was partly sunny and partly wet
during the ten days we sojourned there. On one of the
bright days our quondam invalid walked to the top of the
Croix de Garde, which she could not attempt on our visit
the previous year. It showed how well she then was, and
how much cause for thankfulness we then had.</p>

<p class="p2">We reached Mentone on 12th November 1877, unfortunately
in heavy rain, and, having some time previously
secured them, obtained possession of the same bright rooms
we had occupied the year before, and there we remained
till the end of March.</p>

<p>The weather at Mentone during December and January
was unusually cold&mdash;such a coldness as had not been experienced
for many years. It was penetrating, and hard
to withstand, at least during the hours of darkness. When
the sun was out, the air was warm; but mornings and evenings
were cold, and it was difficult to avoid encountering
cold blasts and drafts, especially in passing from hot rooms
through cold corridors chilled by open doors, and we did find
this year servants very tiresome in leaving doors open which
communicated with the outer air. I believe, though not
conscious of it at the time, that this cold weather and the
cold drafts had reproduced, though it might have then been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
in a very elementary way, the seeds of disease which we
fondly thought had been altogether eradicated.</p>

<p class="p2">We found the municipal authorities busy making a continuation
of the promenade along the shore for a full
additional half-mile or more westward towards Cape Martin,&mdash;an
addition which has ere this proved a great accession to
the place, and will be complete when carried as far as Cape
Martin itself, which, with its forest of trees, is one of the
most charming haunts about Mentone; but the access to it
has hitherto been either by the dusty high road or by the
rough stony beach. Builders had also been busy with
new houses, but the speculation, I doubt, had not proved
profitable, as, owing to the dulness of trade and to the war
in the East, many of the villas remained empty, while even
the hotels did not fill so rapidly as they had done the
previous year. However, when we left in the spring, the
builders had not seemed deterred by the want of demand, for
building operations were still progressing, and I fear much
that in a few years Mentone, if not overbuilt for the number
of visitors, will lose a great deal of its charm as a rural town.
In other respects it was the same as ever, bright and pleasant;
and helping to make it so, we had friends in many
of the other hotels, besides meeting old friends in our
own.</p>

<p class="p2">During the first part of our stay, people were kept in
great anxiety about the course of events in France, and we
never could tell but that any day a revolution might
break out: one result apparently was that newspapers were
occasionally stopped, or at least some did not reach us.
<i>Punch</i> had in one number a certain distinguished gentleman
floundering in the mud. This number did not reach
us through the usual channels, but the cartoon nevertheless
came to the hotel enclosed in a letter to one of the visitors
from a friend in Germany. Perhaps the French are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
people too easily excited to make it safe to allow such
things to be circulated, but it seems strange to our ideas
of free discussion.</p>

<p>When these difficulties were overcome, the British portion
of the population at least were disquieted by the
attitude taken by England in regard to affairs in the East.
Before we left home in 1876, Turkish misrule and
oppression of the provinces had awakened the attention
of the European powers, and a movement for reform was
made. The Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria had also come
to light, and Mr. Gladstone, with all the fervour of his
noble heart, had come to the front, and forced the facts
into lively attention, and not without effect. But the firm
word from us to the Turk, which would have prevented
war, was not spoken, and Russia found herself compelled,
single-handed, to have recourse to arms to terminate oppression.
Russia did not declare war till April 1877.
When she became successful, there was considerable excitement
in the south of England, and it seemed as if many
good people were not careful of what they fed upon, and
for a long time nightly dreamt that the Czar, with one foot
on Russia, was putting another on Constantinople, and, like
a gigantic Gulliver, was just about to haul India off to St.
Petersburg. Into the political causes and consequences of
this excitement it would be out of place to enter here.
Suffice it to say that they made us uneasy during several
months; and had it not been for the extreme moderation
and coolness throughout regulating the counsels of Russia
(which was no doubt thinking as much of taking Jupiter
or Georgium Sidus as of taking India, or even Constantinople,
and was perhaps amused, though displeased, at our
fright), joined to the restraining good sense of the country
at home generally, we should have been involved in war,
all Europe would have been ablaze, and&mdash;selfish thought&mdash;what
would those have had to do who found a foreign
residence necessary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>Among other delicious canards to which we were treated
from time to time during the war in the little French
newspapers, was the astounding information that our beloved
Queen had resolved to resign.</p>

<p class="p2">Two important events, however, did happen during our
stay at Mentone&mdash;first, the somewhat sudden or unlooked-for
death of Victor Emmanuel in January 1878; and, within
a month afterwards, the long-expected death of Pope
Pius IX. On both these occasions a special service was
held in the Cathedral of Mentone, and I suppose 2000
persons must have been crammed into its body and
recesses. Although the church is a pretty large one, the
odour with which it was filled was by no means that of
sanctity, and it was a relief, when the service was over, in
little more than an hour, to get out to the fresh air.
Besides black drapery hung throughout the church, a grand
catafalque was in each case erected in the centre of the
cathedral, in front of which a space was reserved and
seated for the grandees of Mentone. The altar at the back
was denuded, perhaps to afford space, and the singers and
players on instruments were placed between it and the
catafalque, out of sight of the audience. The harsh sounds
of the brass instruments as they blew their trumpet-blasts
thus in our ears seemed vastly inappropriate. The singing
had quite a provincial mediocrity; but on the whole, for a
small country town, I believe it may be said the arrangements,
according to Romanist notions of how such things
should be conducted, were fairly good.</p>

<p class="p2">The death of the Pope, while it prevented the celebration
of the Carnival in Rome, had no influence in preventing
its observance in Mentone and Nice, and scenes similar to
those of last year were enacted, with a difference&mdash;not to
the better&mdash;in the pageant. At Nice the Carnival was, I
believe, grander than ever, and many of the Mentone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
visitors made a day of it there. The Carnival time brought
with it rather appropriately, though probably accidentally,
some fancy balls in Mentone, for which gay and elaborate
costumes were, I believe, procured at Nice. We were
kindly invited to one of these entertainments, but for
reasons declined.</p>

<p>The tendency towards such gaieties seemed this winter
rather on the increase. They suit some, but to those
desirous of quiet evenings it is disturbing to have frequent
routs, and concerts, and other diversions in the drawing-rooms
of the hotels.</p>

<p>We were treated, however, to a different description of
pleasure, in the shape of an exhibition at New Year’s time
of a large collection of water-colour paintings of views in
Mentone, Cannes, Corsica, etc., by Mr. Van der Weldt, a
skilful artist. The pictures were for sale, but the admission
money went to the funds of Helvetia.</p>

<p class="p2">The orange and lemon trees this winter bore scantily,
and we could not help feeling regret to see how few and
far between were the bunches of golden fruit. To what
cause this failure of the crop was to be attributed I do not
know, but I believe that the trees do not bear largely for
two successive years.</p>

<p class="p2">We again, on leaving Mentone, took a carriage to San
Remo, and fortunately had a quiet and warm sunny day
for the drive. The dust lay thick on the road, but there
was no wind to raise it. The loveliness of the ride was the
one atoning circumstance to put against all the pain of
parting with friends, and leaving a place with which so
many happy recollections were associated. We little
thought we were bearing away from it one&mdash;then in apparent
good health, and, fond of travel, thoroughly appreciating all
that she saw&mdash;who would never see it again; for the regret
of leaving was tempered with the hope that it might be our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
privilege, though it might not be absolutely needful, to
return in a future year to this bright land of the olive and
fig tree, the lemon and orange&mdash;this land of cloudless sky
and cheering sun.</p>

<p class="p2">After leaving Ventimiglia, we looked out for the Roman
amphitheatre which had been discovered and was being
excavated, but could not find the place, and our driver was
unable to render us any information or assistance. We
were now in the heart of the scenery forming the <i>locale</i>
of that deeply-interesting story, <i>Dr. Antonio</i>; and on the
previous occasion our driver, I believe, pointed out to us
the veritable house in which Sir John Davenne and his
heavenly daughter had their abode. After paying a passing
visit to friends in Bordighera, we soon afterwards were
again in San Remo.</p>

<p>We remained three weeks at San Remo, and during our
stay had a good deal of wind blowing from the west, and
cold air with heavy rain, and consoled ourselves by thinking
that the wind being in that direction, was probably
more felt at Mentone. On leaving, we proceeded by train
to Alassio, about twenty-eight miles along the coast eastward.
We had heard Alassio a good deal spoken of, and
wished to see it. It is as yet only visited by casual
travellers, and it has not become a place of common winter
resort for invalids. Had we not written for rooms, we
might not have found any carriage waiting to take us to
the Hotel de Rome, which was at the time the only hotel,
I believe, to which English people could go. It was a
drive of about a mile from the station (principally through
the long narrow streets of the town) to the hotel, which
fronts the beach, just out of and to the west of the town.
It is a comparatively new house, and the accommodation is
fairly good and clean. Another hotel, ‘The Grand,’ on a
much larger scale, has been built, also fronting the sea, but
about the middle of the town. It was not, however, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
opened, and the situation did not seem so desirable, though
nearer the station.</p>

<p>We found Alassio to be one of those little Italian
coast towns in the Riviera which are by no means attractive
in themselves. The population is said to be 5500, so
that it is of some extent. It is dirty and disagreeable, and
unfortunately, like some others, is not shelved away upon
an avoidable eminence, but is stuck down upon the very
best part of the shore. The towers of the cathedral and
other churches, and the structure of the houses, combine to
give it, at a little distance, a picturesque appearance. A
sandy beach forms the shore, on which, opposite the town,
many fishing boats lay. The sands, of a pale yellow or
white, though they may afford good bathing, are not
interesting, shells and sea-weed being scarce. The town
lies at the head or in the centre of a bay formed by two
projecting capes or protecting arms, the Capo della Melle
on the west and the Capo S. Croce on the east. Between
these two points the distance may, I suppose, be about three
miles. A semicircular cordon of hills runs back from their
termini, and with an inner circle surrounds and hems in
Alassio lying in the basin below. The slopes of most of
the hills, at least of the inner circle, are covered with olive,
carroube, and other trees, giving them a richly-wooded aspect;
but the hills themselves do not rise to any great altitude.
They are sufficiently high and close upon the town to give
much&mdash;perhaps, in summer, too much&mdash;shelter to Alassio,
and to afford room for supposing that it might become,
on a smaller scale, another Mentone for winter residence.
Possibly if no old Italian town had existed there, and everything
could be laid out anew, Alassio might be made a
good place and suitable for strangers; but the great drawbacks
to it for residence, and not regarding it from a
medical point of view, are the existence of this old dirty
town, which usurps nearly the whole of the shore space,
and is far from attractive, and the confined or limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
situation. I believe that many fine walks may be found
about it, but the mountains lack the height and picturesque
grandeur of those of Mentone, and there seem to be no
valleys and rivers to offer variety. Some English families,
however, have been so pleased with it as to have built
houses there, for permanent occupation, on the slopes of the
hills. One of these we visited&mdash;that of Mr. Gibb, a Scotch
gentleman. Its position is commanding, and derives shelter
from the hills behind; and from the terraces overlooking
the town, the views were fine. The ground was laid out in
the style of hanging gardens, full of orange trees. At leaving,
Mr. Gibb kindly caused a basketful of oranges to be
plucked and given to us, and they were of the most delicious
flavour; indeed, I believe the Alassio oranges are noted for
their excellent quality. Although a little society is to be
found at Alassio, it struck me as a dull place of residence
except to those who are fond of retirement. A great improvement
to the town would be the formation of a promenade
along the shore, as at Mentone, Cannes, and Nice.
Were this done, it would help to draw strangers, and if
strangers came, other improvements would follow.</p>

<p class="p2">On the first afternoon, we had, after arrival, time to take
a walk westward along the beach for about a mile to a
small village Laigueglia, which, as usual, possesses a church
with a campanile; other large buildings like granaries
fronted the sea. We took, the following day, a much more
interesting walk up the height of Santa Croce to the eastward,
encountering unexpectedly by the way a smart
shower, from which some protection was afforded by the
trees. Upon leaving the town, a paved donkey-path leads
up the hillside, skirted by woods (the carroube trees here
growing luxuriantly), to the ruins of an old chapel, whence
an extensive panorama spreads out on one side, back
over the hills behind the town, and down on the town and
ocean below; while eastward the rockbound coast stretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
away, visible as far, I believe, on a clear day, as Genoa and
beyond it. But the day was not sufficiently clear to see so far.</p>

<p class="p2">Dr. Giuseppe Schneer has published a pamphlet of about
eighty pages on Alassio, titled, <i>Alassio ed il suo clima confrontato
con quello di S. Remo, Mentone, Nizza, e Cannes</i>.
It is in Italian, unfortunately, and consists of three parts.
The first and largest part contains medical advice, leading
up, of course, to approval of Alassio. The second part
gives some information about the town, its population,
schools, hotels, etc.; and in reference to its healthiness,
adduces a table of mortality from which it would appear
that during nine years the average was about 100 deaths
per annum in a population assumed to be now and throughout
5500, or 1 in 55, which would certainly be extraordinarily
low. Another table is given to show the duration
of life, evidencing considerable longevity. The third part
deals with the meteorology of Alassio, and contains some
tables, from which it would appear, if the observations be
correctly taken, Alassio stands well, and, on the whole,
obtains a higher temperature than places on the Riviera
with which it is compared&mdash;a result which may be accounted
for by its being more shut in. I take the liberty of quoting
an excerpt from one of these tables (p. 74):&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Schneer also states that in the five months from
November to March there are 79 days all bright, 37·5 half
so, 36 cloudy, and 20 bad.</p>

<p>It may be, therefore, that the climate of Alassio is one
suitable for invalids, and living is moderate, as pension can
be had at the Hotel de Rome for 7 and 8 francs per day
<i>tout compris</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">After being two nights there, we left for Genoa. The day
was fine, and having a compartment to ourselves, we had
full opportunity of looking about and enjoying the scenery.
The distance is about fifty-seven miles, and as the train
took nearly four hours to arrive quietly at Genoa, we moved
leisurely. I paced one of our bedrooms at the Hotel de
Gènes, and it seemed to be 27 feet long by 21 feet wide,
and probably it was 20 feet high. In the afternoon we drove
out again to see the Campo Santo, and found little change
since last year. On the following day we visited most
of the places we had seen the previous year, and some
others, including some additional palaces already noticed.
With a little difficulty we made discovery of the Via Orifici
(a narrow street in the heart of the town, not far from
the hotel), where the filigree shops are, and made a few
purchases. The shops are on both sides of the street, and
contain sometimes beautiful specimens of this delicate work
in silver and gold; perhaps the shop of Salvi exhibited the
largest collection of choice handiwork. In buying, it is
well to remember one is transacting in Italy. Genoa has a
Galleria, but not nearly so handsome as that at Milan, although
equally suitable for its purpose. Last year we had seen
it in course of construction, but it was now completed,
and some of the best shops in Genoa were opened in it.
But at the time of our visit it was not fully occupied. At
night it was, as at Milan, crowded by the townspeople
and visitors. A long, wide, lofty arcade like this, covered
over by a glass roof, and brilliantly lighted up, is naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
an attraction, and something of the kind in our large towns
might induce a withdrawal of many from the gin-palaces
and drinking-shops, the glare and comfort of which seem
to be so great an inducement and temptation to certain
classes. But, like the Italian galleries, they require to be
thoroughfares in good central situations&mdash;not <i>cul-de-sacs</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon of the third day we left by train for
Turin. A few drops fell as we left, augmenting as we proceeded
under inky clouds to heavy rain. We obtained our
last glimpse of our old friend the Mediterranean just after
leaving Genoa. The railway stations, not improved by the
rain, looked all so dirty&mdash;filthy, indeed. At Alessandria,
where we had an hour to wait, affording time to dine, the
whole platform was most disagreeable, from the abominable
habit (elsewhere alluded to) the Italians have of defiling
every place, even the floors of churches, so that it is not
uncommon to see a notice up in the churches requesting
that it be not practised. However, good service is done by
the women, who trail their gowns over the floors, and thus,
with a thoughtful consideration for others and an unselfish
disregard for themselves, keep them cleaner than they
would otherwise be.</p>

<p>We arrived at Turin about eight o’clock in the evening,
and found quarters in the Ligurie, a large, new, first-class
hotel, not far from the station. The double windows, thick
shutters, and the cloth curtains outside the bedroom doors,
were suggestive of what descent in temperature there may
sometimes be in Turin; but except a little cold and damp
in the evening, resulting from the rain which had fallen
before our arrival, we had it warm and sunny during the
three days we remained there. The following forenoon we
devoted to a long drive in and about Turin. The streets
are exceedingly regular and wide, and the houses being lofty
and the town of considerable extent and full of handsome
public buildings and monuments, Turin has all the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
of a capital; but though a city upwards of 2000 years
old, there is about it quite a modern air. The view along
several of the streets is terminated by a grand vista of snowy
mountains, and one of the sights of Turin&mdash;indeed, its great
sight&mdash;is the view obtained from it of the Alps. To witness
this in perfection, it should be seen from a commanding
height early in the morning of a clear day. We accordingly,
soon after breakfast, driving past the public park and gardens,
and round an imposing quadrangular building called the
Castel di Valentino, and crossing the river Po by a stone
bridge of five arches, were deposited at the foot of the steep
hill on which the Capuchin Monastery is built. Here, by
a road winding round the hill, we walked to the top, and
from the plateau beheld the most magnificent mountain
prospect I had ever seen, or which I suppose is visible in
Europe. Right in front of us, against a sky all but clear,
rose the great range of the snowy Alps, stretching far as the
eye could reach to right and left, the nearest being only about
fifteen miles distant, but seeming much nearer as seen through
a transparent atmosphere over a range of low hills lying in
front of them. Monte Viso, conical in shape, about forty-five
miles to the south-west, in which the river Po finds its
source, rises prominently like a huge tusk, the rest like an
enormous jaw, in wavy line of peaks or serrated folds.
Between the river Po, flowing below, and the mountains,
the ground appears one vast level plain, on which the city
rests in regular lines of lofty houses, the monotony being
broken by the numerous towers and domes of the public
buildings; and conspicuous among them is the great ugly
peculiar square dome of the Jewish Synagogue, a far from
pleasing object. In a different direction, away to the
north-east, we saw the Superga or Royal Mausoleum, built
on the crest of a hill much higher than the monastery, and
commanding a fully better view. To visit it and the royal
tombs is a day’s excursion, and we gave it up. The royal
palace was among the places in town which we visited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
Its magnificent rooms are reached by a truly regal staircase
of marble adorned by sculpture. The armoury, an interesting
exhibition, is not far from the palace. A long room in
it is filled with figures of men-at-arms on horseback clad
with the armour of different periods.</p>

<p>The streets of Turin are to a large extent lined by
arcades, and no doubt in bad weather, and especially in
snowstorms, such a method of construction must be useful,
the shops, however, being generally placed under them.</p>

<p>Turin possesses many fine monuments. One of the finest
is that to Cavour, inscribed, ‘A Camillo Cavour nato a
Torino il x. Agosto <span class="smcap">mdcccx.</span>, morto il vi. Giugno <span class="smcap">mdccclxi.</span>’
A kneeling female figure, representing doubtless Italia, is
presenting him with a garland; while below, the base is
adorned by emblematical figures at least life-size, and, like
the statue, of white marble&mdash;all very tasteful. Another and
very singular monument is that to the Duke of Genoa.
His horse falls to the ground on its knees wounded, and
the rider, the Duke, sitting on the horse, is resting one foot
on the ground and waving his sword.</p>

<p>We had a Sunday in Turin, and in the morning went into
the cathedral. It is a large building, not very imposing;
but inside it is dark, and the dirtiest church we had seen
in Italy, which is saying a good deal. To Protestants, the
Waldensian Church is a place of great interest. Unfortunately
we had been informed at the hotel that the Italian service
was in the morning, and the French service in the afternoon;
and we therefore attended service in the morning, in the
English Church in the yard immediately behind it. Returning
in the afternoon, we found our informant was mistaken; the
French service had been in the morning, the afternoon
service was in Italian. The church, which is a large one,
was scantily attended by a shifting congregation of the
poorer classes of Italians. Many, apparently Roman
Catholics, just entered to see what was doing, and after a
few minutes went out again, to be replaced by others. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
we understood little of what was said, we did not stay the
service out. We learned at dinner from a lady who had
been there in the forenoon, that the morning service had
been in French, that the church was crowded by a most
respectable congregation, and that the whole service was
most interesting.</p>

<p>Turin is a place in which a few days can be well spent,
and an excursion is not unfrequently made from it to
the Waldensian valleys, part of the way to which is by
railway.</p>

<p class="p2">We had a beautiful day on which to leave for Aix-les-Bains
by the Mont Cenis Tunnel. The view of the
snowy mountains was brilliantly clear as we approached
them. In about six miles we reached the first or low hills.
Thenceforth the scenery along the line of railway was at
some parts wild and grand, and at others the hills were
surmounted by structures which gave a picturesque character
to them. At last we reached and passed through the Mont
Cenis Tunnel. The time taken in passing through was
about twenty-eight minutes. It was long to be boxed up
in the dark, but it did not feel so long as I anticipated.
Once or twice I put down a window; the air felt slightly
damp, not cold. On issuing from it on the French side, the
railway makes a long detour to reach the lower level
of Modane, where luggage is examined by the French
<i>douaniers</i>, and we changed into French carriages, which
were superior in comfort to those of the Italian line. The
scenery all along to Chambery and Aix-les-Bains was
among the mountains, some of them capped with snow.</p>

<p>We stayed, as we had planned, a week at Aix-les-Bains,
and we should have enjoyed it but that great part of the
time we had rain, and the air, though warm, was moist. A
range of low hills separates Aix from Lake Bourget, enclosed
on the other side by steep rugged mountains, their summits
visible over the hills. A short walk takes one to the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
of these hills, whence an excellent view is had of the
lake, upon which a steamer plies during the summer. The
lake is reached by the road at a part fringed by tall
poplars about one and a half to two miles distant, offering
a pleasant stroll on a fine afternoon such as we had to
walk to it.</p>

<p class="p2">We left by a morning train for Dijon, and shortly after
the sky got black, and we were obliged to change carriages
at Culoz in drenching rain, the station being destitute of
cover so necessary at a junction like this, or indeed at every
railway station. As we passed along, the whole country
seemed to be inundated. Both at Dijon and Fontainebleau
we were caught in showers unexpectedly. At Paris, where
we rested for a few days, we had rain, but principally
through the night. At Boulogne we had a shower. Crossing
thence, we landed, after a beautiful passage, at Folkestone
in May 1878, and proceeded by Bristol to Stoke Bishop.
Here, instead of the sunshine with which the neighbourhood
of Clifton is usually favoured at this season, and to which
we had looked forward, we were still pursued by almost daily
rain. After remaining six weeks looking constantly for
better weather, we got back to Scotland.</p>

<p class="p2">And here with a sad heart I must close. I had written
most of these pages at a time when we had every belief
that the changes experienced had effected cure&mdash;at
least to the extent of allowing us to go home for the
summer. And we had been so much longer away than we
had proposed when we left, that not unnaturally we were
the more anxious to be back. The last change was
destined to be fatal. Looking to second causes, it is probable
that the unforeseen and unusual moisture to which
we had been exposed everywhere after leaving Italy,
succeeding so long a residence in a dry climate, had
developed latent seeds of disease, and weakness had latterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
been increased by exposure to a cold draft inducing cough.
Whatever was the cause, she for whose benefit we had
taken this prolonged tour in sunny lands, and who we had
fondly hoped had been restored to health, sank within a
few months from the time of touching her native shore.
It was when hopes were beginning to revive, and she herself
had thought the crisis was past, a sudden change for
the worse took place. After a restless night, the morning
light, for which she had anxiously longed, only arrived to
bear her soul peacefully away from weakness and solicitude
to a land brighter than any she had looked on here.
Though gentle and unpresuming, her cheerful and unselfish
disposition, joined to other graces, and to good sense born
of a well-balanced and well-informed mind, soon made her
acquaintance valued wherever she went; and, scattered as so
many are, perhaps it is only through this little record some
may chance to learn that they have lost an esteemed
friend.</p>

At Naples I sat next a German who helped himself to four thick slices of
roast beef, then, according to German custom, began by placing one above
another, and cutting the whole into little squares by drawing his knife first
lengthways and then crossways through them, and having so divided the
beef, took his knife and shovelled, in quick succession, all the pieces into his
mouth. Fish is often a scarce commodity, yet I have seen German ladies,
after having liberally helped themselves to it, call for more as they would for
more of any other course, though it is unusual for others to ask a second
supply of any course.</p>

In Mr. Birrel’s interesting <i>Life of Dr. Brock</i>, a man of great power and,
I believe, of much liberality of mind, the following passage (p. 241) occurs in
reference to a Sunday in crossing the Atlantic:&mdash;’Next day was all that a
Sunday at home could be. We had service, Mr. Nolan again officiating&mdash;the
captain, however, this time reading the prayers himself. One thing
struck me painfully: when the absolution came to be read, the captain
gave way to the priest, who alone stood and alone spoke; he alone had
authority in the great matter of remission. The captain had none. Of what
is this the germ?’</p>

A French kilometre is equal to 1093·633 yards; an English mile is
1760 yards. Two miles are therefore more than three kilometres, and two
kilometres are equal to about one mile and a quarter (1¼). But all the foreign
measures differ, and it is puzzling therefore to know from the railway guides
and others what are the distances in English miles. A uniform mileage
system would be exceedingly useful. In fact, the statesman who could
effect uniformity in measures, weights, and coinage throughout Europe,
would do more real good than is obtained by more glittering acts.</p>

It would be hardly possible for me to give from recollection a complete
list of all the hotels and pensions in Mentone, but I may note some at least
of the most prominent. Having had friends in many of them, we had occasional
opportunities of seeing them, and learning a little regarding them;
but only residence in each could enable anybody to speak authoritatively,
and therefore observations now made must be taken in a very general way,
and subject to all allowances, and as perhaps mistaken.</p>
<p class="pfc4">At the extreme west, the Pavillon is, I believe, a well-appointed hotel;
but it is fully half a mile outside the town, to some a recommendation.
Between it and a small house, now called the Hotel Anglo-Americaine, near
to the Boirigo Bridge, there are several elegant villas, some of them to let
furnished. East of this bridge, facing the promenade, are the Pension Condamine
(small and moderate) and some other minor houses and pensions;
then the Hotel de Russie (one on Gaze’s list); and crossing the Carrei, the
first house beyond, and overlooking the public gardens, is called the Pension
Americaine, in reality an hotel, with good cuisine, kept by an active, clever,
and attentive landlady; near to it, the Pension Camous, a tall, overtopping,
narrow building, at which the town street may be said to commence;
adjoining it, the Pension or Hotel de Londres; and a little farther east, and
more in town, the Hotels Westminster, Victoria, and Menton&mdash;all large,
and, I believe, expensive; and, last of all, the Hotel du Midi. Beyond
the Promenade, close to the market-place, and not far from the harbour,
the Hotel Bristol. With the exception of the two last, all have gardens of
more or less size between them and the promenade, and all have access on
the other side to the public street.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Back from or on the other side of the main street, there are many other
hotels and pensions, among which may be mentioned, west of the Carrei,
the Splendide (on Gaze’s list), a comfortable hotel within a garden; the
Hotel du Parc, on the avenue leading to the railway station, with good rooms,
although the entrance or site is not promising. On the east side of the
Carrei and some way up beyond the railway, which it dominates, the Hotel du
Louvre, a large, well-appointed hotel, apparently frequented by Germans and
Dutch; behind it, and rather higher, there is the great Hotel des Îles
Britanniques, commanding good views, in every respect first class, patronized
by the English (though not exclusively so, one long table being set for
the English and another long one for the foreigners). The landlord claims
it to be the most expensive hotel in Mentone. Both these last-mentioned
hotels are near to the railway station, but carriages have to make a circuit to
reach them. Both are under shelter of an olive-covered hill rising high and
steep immediately behind, which also affords similar shelter to the Hotels
des Princes, Venise, D’Orient, Turin, and others, lying nearly in a line to
the eastward. The D’Orient and Turin have both gardens in front,&mdash;that
of the former is large, and in the garden of the latter a bed of roses flourishes
in full flower all the winter through. Both are good houses, but the views
from the windows and grounds are confined, and street houses shut them out
almost entirely from the view of the sea. If, however, view be not considered
important, the position is comparatively sheltered. There are also
about this part several pensions, such as the ‘Des Alpes,’&mdash;a small house,
and moderate charges.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the east bay, after passing the old town, which in the afternoon always
casts a dank shadow on the part of the road which underlies it, called the
Quai Bonaparte, requiring the invalid to take special precautions, and passing
the drain pipe, the first hotel met is the Grande Bretagne, one of the
oldest houses. It is that upon Cook’s list for Mentone, and consequently
seems to be always well filled. Up on the height behind, a little to the
eastward, are the Hotels d’Italie and Belle Vue, both comfortable; but
the ascent to them is steep, the fatigue being, however, rewarded by the fine
view from the terraces and windows. Returning to the road below, which is
a part of the Corniche, we observe the East English Church, and next to it
the Hotel de la Paix close to the street, but having a garden to the back.
Facing it across the road is the only bathing establishment of Mentone.
Adjoining its east side, but back from the road within a garden, the Hotel
des Anglais where Dr. Bennett obtains his quarters. A little beyond, a small
piece of ground, probably an acre in extent, has recently been acquired and
laid out as a public garden, in which the band occasionally plays; and amidst
a cluster of other hotels and pensions farther east, the Grand Hotel, a comfortable,
large house, charging moderately. If the visitor prefer or is recommended
to reside in the east bay, he will find the extreme east (called the
Quartier Garavent, though so much farther from town, and though hot and
dusty) is the choicer situation. There is, however, an omnibus to town
every hour from the far east to about the Hotel du Pavillon, at the extreme
west end.</p>

A recently-published guide-book to the south of France says, with
regard to Mentone:&mdash;’A kind of gloom pervades Menton. The strip of
ground on which it stands is narrow, and so are the streets.’ ‘The valleys
are narrow and sombre. The roads up the mountains are steep, badly paved,
and are generally traversed on donkeys, which go slowly and require so much
chastisement that an ordinary walker will find it less fatiguing to dispense
with them.’ It also sets down the population at 12,000, and that of Cannes,
by far the larger town, at 7000. These are statements which require revision,
as they do not accord with the facts.</p>

It is impossible to place reliance on the exactness of such figures. They
must throughout be taken as obtained from different sources, and possibly in
no one case correct. I should, for example, here doubt whether Castiglione
stands as high as the castle of Ste. Agnese.</p>

It is the custom in the Riviera, and probably elsewhere in France, to give
free of charge, to those who are on pension, their lunch to take with them on
such excursions, which they would otherwise have had at the hotel.</p>

The arena of Nismes is 148 by 112 yards, height 74 feet, and accommodated
32,000 spectators; arena, 74 by 42 yards. The Colosseum, 205 by 170
yards, height 156 feet, accommodating 87,000 spectators (besides containing
standing room for 23,000 more in the porticoes and surrounding passages);
arena, 93 by 58 yards. But in stating these and other measurements, it is
always right to keep in mind that in different books the figures do not correspond,
and one well-informed and most reliable writer states the dimensions of
the Colosseum at about 40 feet more each way than the above. Mr. Storey’s
figures for the Colosseum also vary from the above several yards in each
measurement. For a pretty full account of the Colosseum, reference may be
made to Storey’s <i>Roba di Roma</i>, vol. i. chap. ix.</p>

The extent, however, is variously computed. One writer, generally very
exact, says: ‘According to Romani and Nibby’s plan of Rome,’ Caracalla’s
baths ‘covered an area of 370 yards square, or 28 English acres.’ ‘Eustace
makes the extent twice as great.’ Gibbon states that they were a mile in circumference,
which would be 193,600 square yards, or 40 acres. Hare says
they covered a space of 2,625,000 square yards, which is equal to 542 acres.
It is not improbable that some measurements may refer merely to the ground
covered by buildings, and that others comprehend ground not so covered.
But even this explanation will not account for such extraordinary discrepancies.</p>

Bædeker says: ‘At the back of the Pantheon are situated the ruins of
the Thermæ of Agrippa, the proximity of which to the Pantheon once gave
rise to the absurd conjecture that the temple originally belonged to the baths,
and was afterwards converted into a temple.’ In a matter of this kind, however,
the authority of such a man as Mr. Thomson is much to be preferred to
that of any writer in a guide-book.</p>

This number is stated upon an authority which differs in the further
figures here given, some of which seem almost incredibly large. How the
9025 baths can be reconciled with the statement (p. 299) of sixteen bathing

I see it stated that in 1851 the number of Romish priests in Great
Britain was 958; of Romish chapels, 683; of monasteries, 17; of religious
houses for women, 53. In 1879 these numbers were increased to 1238,
1386, 118, and 272 respectively. The number of the laity doubtless has
increased, though possibly, and as it is to be hoped, not correspondingly.</p>
